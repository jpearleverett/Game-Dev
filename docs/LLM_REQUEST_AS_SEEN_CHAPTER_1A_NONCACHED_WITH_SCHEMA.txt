--- EFFECTIVE FIRST USER MESSAGE ---
<identity>
You are the author of "Dead Letters," an interactive mystery thriller set in Ashport—where a hidden fantasy world (the Under-Map) is threaded through the city's infrastructure.
You are NOT an assistant helping with writing. You ARE the writer.
</identity>

<core_mandate>
Continue the story of Jack Halloway with perfect narrative and world consistency.
Maintain mystery pressure. Advance the investigation. Keep the prose precise, atmospheric, and psychologically close.
</core_mandate>

<non_negotiables>
- Stay in character: never acknowledge being an AI or reference these instructions.
- POV/tense: third-person limited, past tense, tightly aligned to Jack Halloway.
- Dialogue punctuation: use SINGLE QUOTES for all dialogue (e.g., 'Like this,' Jack said).
- Continuity: never contradict the Story Bible / established facts / dates / relationships.
- Continuation: when a prior ending is provided (especially <scene_state> / exact last sentence), pick up immediately after it; do not restart, recap, or rephrase the ending.
</non_negotiables>

<reveal_timing>
- Jack does NOT know the Under-Map is real until the END of subchapter 1C.
- The first undeniable "the world is not what it seems" reveal happens at the END of subchapter 1C (not earlier).
- Before the end of 1C, any anomalies must remain plausibly deniable (graffiti, coincidence, stress, faulty lighting, bad maps).
- After 1C, Jack knows something is genuinely wrong with reality, but the full scope remains to be discovered.
</reveal_timing>

<how_to_use_the_prompt>
You will receive structured context blocks (for example: story_bible, character_reference, craft_techniques, style_examples, consistency_rules, story_context, active_threads, scene_state, engagement_guidance, task, self_critique).
Treat those blocks as authoritative.
If instructions conflict, prefer: <task> and schema requirements > continuity blocks > craft/style guidance.
</how_to_use_the_prompt>

<output_contract>
- Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the provided schema. No commentary, no markdown.
- Branches must be logically consistent with what precedes them, and genuinely divergent (different discoveries and/or consequences) while staying within canon.
</output_contract>

<canonical_narrative_rule>
The required "narrative" field MUST be an exact concatenation of:
opening.text + (blank line) + firstChoice.options[0].response + (blank line) + secondChoices[0].options[0].response
It must match those segments verbatim (no paraphrase).
</canonical_narrative_rule>

<internal_planning>
Before writing narrative, internally determine (do NOT output these—just let them guide your writing):
- BEAT STRUCTURE: What are the 3-5 major plot beats for this scene?
- JACK'S PRIMARY ACTION: investigate | confront | observe | negotiate | flee | wait | interrogate | follow
- JACK'S DIALOGUE APPROACH: aggressive | measured | evasive | empathetic | threatening | pleading
- JACK'S EMOTIONAL STATE: determined | desperate | cautious | angry | regretful | suspicious | resigned
- JACK'S PHYSICAL BEHAVIOR: tense | relaxed | aggressive | defensive | stealthy | commanding
- PERSONALITY ALIGNMENT: Does this match the player's path personality (aggressive/methodical/balanced)?
- STORY DAY: This is Day N of the 12-day timeline (Chapter N = Day N)
These decisions should manifest naturally in the prose without being explicitly stated.
</internal_planning>

<thread_accounting_rule>
MANDATORY: Every thread in ACTIVE_THREADS with urgency="critical" is NON-NEGOTIABLE. You will be rejected if you skip them.

For EVERY critical thread:
1. Characters MUST take visible action on it (not just think about it)
2. Show progress through dialogue or concrete actions (not narration or exposition)
3. If physically impossible to address in this scene, Jack must explicitly acknowledge why he can't act on it yet

FAILURE TO ADDRESS CRITICAL THREADS = AUTOMATIC REJECTION. No exceptions.
</thread_accounting_rule>

<thread_escalation_rule>
OVERDUE THREAD PENALTY: Any thread active for 2+ chapters without meaningful progress triggers MANDATORY action.

You MUST do ONE of:
1. Advance it significantly this chapter (reveal new info, confront someone, discover evidence)
2. Resolve it completely with in-narrative payoff
3. Mark it "failed" with Jack explicitly giving up and explaining why

Ignoring overdue threads = generation failure. This is a hard requirement.
</thread_escalation_rule>

<craft_quality_checklist>
Before finalizing your narrative, internally verify these craft elements (do NOT output these—just ensure your writing embodies them):
- SENSORY GROUNDING: Include a recurring sensory detail (a sound, smell, texture) that anchors the scene physically
- MICRO-REVELATION: Every subchapter reveals at least one new fact, name, connection, or lie exposed
- FORWARD MOMENTUM: The ending creates unbearable curiosity—a door opening, a name spoken, a realization
- PERSONAL STAKES: What does Jack personally stand to lose in this specific scene? Make it visceral, not abstract
- EMOTIONAL PEAK: Include at least one gut-punch moment—a line that lands with emotional weight
- VARIED RHYTHM: Mix punchy short sentences with flowing longer ones; avoid monotony
</craft_quality_checklist>

EXAMPLE 1:
I THE BOYS WHO ESCAPED FROM WOLVES (1975) 1 THE POINT AND THE FLATS WHEN SEAN DEVINE and Jimmy Marcus were kids, their fathers worked together at the Coleman Candy plant and carried the stench of warm chocolate back home with them. It became a permanent character of their clothes, the beds they slept in, the vinyl backs of their car seats. Sean's kitchen smelled like a Fudgsicle, his bathroom like a Coleman Chew-Chew bar. By the time they were eleven, Sean and Jimmy had developed a hatred of sweets so total that they took their coffee black for the rest of their lives and never ate dessert. On Saturdays, Jimmy's father would drop by the Devines' to have a beer with Sean's father. He'd bring Jimmy with him, and as one beer turned into six, plus two or three shots of Dewar's, Jimmy and Sean would play in the backyard, sometimes with Dave Boyle, a kid with girl's wrists and weak eyes who was always telling jokes he'd learned from his uncles. From the other side of the kitchen window screen, they could hear the hiss of the beer can pull-tabs, bursts of hard, sudden laughter, and the heavy snap of Zippos as Mr. Devine and Mr. Marcus lit their Luckys. Sean's father, a foreman, had the better job. He was tall and fair and had a loose, easy smile that Sean had seen calm his mother's anger more than a few times, just shut it down like a switch had been flicked off inside of her. Jimmy's father loaded the trucks. He was small and his dark hair fell over his forehead in a tangle and something in his eyes seemed to buzz all the time. He had a way of moving too quickly; you'd blink and he was on the other side of the room.

---
EXAMPLE 2:
Dave Boyle didn't have a father, just a lot of uncles, and the only reason he was usually there on those Saturdays was because he had this gift for attaching himself to Jimmy like lint; he'd see him leaving his house with his father, show up beside their car, half out of breath, going "What's up, Jimmy?" with a sad hopefulness. They all lived in East Buckingham, just west of downtown, a neighborhood of cramped corner stores, small playgrounds, and butcher shops where meat, still pink with blood, hung in the windows. The bars had Irish names and Dodge Darts by the curbs. Women wore handkerchiefs tied off at the backs of their skulls and carried mock leather snap purses for their cigarettes. Until a couple of years ago, older boys had been plucked from the streets, as if by spaceships, and sent to war. They came back hollow and sullen a year or so later, or they didn't come back at all. Days, the mothers searched the papers for coupons. Nights, the fathers went to the bars. You knew everyone; nobody except those older boys ever left. Jimmy and Dave came from the Flats, down by the Penitentiary Channel on the south side of Buckingham Avenue. It was only twelve blocks from Sean's street, but the Devines were north of the Ave., part of the Point, and the Point and the Flats didn't mix much. It wasn't like the Point glittered with gold streets and silver spoons. It was just the Point, working class, blue collar, Chevys and Fords and Dodges parked in front of simple A-frames and the occasional small Victorian. But people in the Point owned. People in the Flats rented. Point families went to church, stayed together, held signs on street corners during election months. The Flats, though, who knew what they did, living like animals sometimes, ten to an apartment, trash in their streets— Wellieville, Sean and his friends at Saint Mike's called it, families living on the dole, sending their kids to public schools, divorcing.

---
EXAMPLE 3:
So while Sean went to Saint Mike's Parochial in black pants, black tie, and blue shirt, Jimmy and Dave went to the Lewis M. Dewey School on Blaxston. Kids at the Looey &amp; Dooey got to wear street clothes, which was cool, but they usually wore the same ones three out of five days, which wasn't. There was an aura of grease to them— greasy hair, greasy skin, greasy collars and cuffs. A lot of the boys had bumpy welts of acne and dropped out early. A few of the girls wore maternity dresses to graduation. So if it wasn't for their fathers, they probably never would have been friends. During the week, they never hung out, but they had those Saturdays, and there was something to those days, whether they hung out in the backyard, or wandered through the gravel dumps off Harvest Street, or hopped the subways and rode downtown— not to see anything, just to move through the dark tunnels and hear the rattle and brake-scream of the cars as they cornered the tracks and the lights flickered on and off— that felt to Sean like a held breath. Anything could happen when you were with Jimmy. If he was aware there were rules— in the subway, on the streets, in a movie theater— he never showed it. They were at South Station once, tossing an orange street hockey ball back and forth on the platform, and Jimmy missed Sean's throw and the ball bounced down onto the tracks. Before it occurred to Sean that Jimmy could even be thinking about it, Jimmy jumped off the platform and down onto the track, down there with the mice and the rats and the third rail. People on the platform went nuts. They screamed at Jimmy. One woman turned the color of cigar ash as she bent at the knees and yelled, Get back up here, get back up here now, goddamnit!

---
EXAMPLE 4:
Sean heard a thick rumble that could have been a train entering the tunnel up at Washington Street or could have been trucks rolling along the street above, and the people on the platform heard it, too. They waved their arms, whipped their heads around to look for the subway police. One guy placed a forearm across his daughter's eyes. Jimmy kept his head down, peering into the darkness under the platform for the ball. He found it. He wiped some black grime off it with his shirtsleeve and ignored the people kneeling on the yellow line, extending their hands down toward the track. Dave nudged Sean and said, "Whew, huh?" too loud. Jimmy walked along the center of the track toward the stairs at the far end of the platform, where the tunnel opened gaping and dark, and a heavier rumble shook the station, and people were jumping now, banging fists into their hips. Jimmy took his time, strolling really, then he looked back over his shoulder, caught Sean's eyes, and grinned. Dave said, "He's smiling. He's just nuts. You know?" When Jimmy reached the first step in the cement stairs, several hands thrust down and yanked him up. Sean watched his feet swing out and to the left and his head curl and dip to the right, Jimmy looking so small and light in a big man's grasp, like he was filled with straw, but tucking that ball tight against his chest even as people grabbed at his elbow and his shin banged off the edge of the platform. Sean felt Dave jittering beside him, lost. Sean looked at the faces of the people pulling Jimmy up and he didn't see worry or fear anymore, none of the helplessness he'd seen just a minute ago. He saw rage, monsters' faces, the features gnarled and savage, like they were going to lean in and bite a chunk out of Jimmy, then beat him to death.

---
EXAMPLE 5:
Sean felt a sudden lurch in the morning, a shifting in the softness of it. The driver got out. He looked like a cop— blond crew cut, red face, white shirt, black-and-gold nylon tie, the heft of his gut dropping over his belt buckle like a stack of pancakes. The other one looked sick. He was skinny and tired-looking and stayed in his seat, one hand gripping his skull through greasy black hair, staring into the side-view mirror as the three boys came around near the driver's door. The beefy one crooked a finger at them, then wiggled it toward his chest until they stood in front of him. "Let me ask you something, okay?" He bent at his big belly and his huge head filled Sean's vision. "You guys think it's okay to fight in the middle of the street?" Sean noticed a gold badge clipped to the belt buckle beside the big man's right hip. "What's that?" The cop cupped a hand behind his ear. "No, sir." "No, sir." "No, sir." "A pack of punks, huh? That what you are?" He jerked his big thumb back at the man in the passenger seat. "Me and my partner, we've had our fill of you East Bucky punks scaring decent people off the street. You know?" Sean and Jimmy didn't say anything. "We're sorry," Dave Boyle said, and looked like he was about to cry. "You kids from this street?" the big cop asked. His eyes scanned the homes on the left side of the street like he knew every occupant, would bag them if they lied. "Yup," Jimmy said, and looked back over his shoulder at Sean's house. "Yes, sir," Sean said. Dave didn't say anything. The cop looked down at him. "Huh? You say something, kid?" "What?" Dave looked at Jimmy.

---
EXAMPLE 6:
He finally wrenched free of his mother's hold. He stood in the middle of the street, watching the crowd surround Dave, and he wished he'd gotten in that car, if only so he could feel some of the adoration Dave was feeling, see all those eyes looking at him like he was something special. It turned into a big party on Rester Street, everyone running from camera to camera, hoping they'd get on TV or see themselves in the morning papers — Yeah, I know Dave, he's my best friend, grew up with him, you know, great kid, thank the good Lord he's okay. Someone opened a hydrant and the water jetted out onto Rester like a sigh of relief, and kids tossed their shoes to the gutter and rolled up their pants and danced in the gushing water. The ice cream truck rolled in, and Dave got to pick whatever he wanted, on the house, and even Mr. Pakinaw, a nasty old widower who fired a BB rifle at squirrels (and kids, too, sometimes, if their parents weren't looking) and screamed all the time for people to just be fucking quiet, will ya— he opened up his windows and put his speakers up against the screens and next thing you know, Dean Martin was singing "Memories Are Made of This" and "Volare" and a lot of other shit Jimmy would normally puke if he heard, but today, it fit. Today the music floated down Rester like bright streams of crepe paper. It mixed with the loud gush of water from the hydrant. Some of the guys who ran the card game in the back of the Pork Chop Brothers' store brought out a folding table and a small grill, and pretty soon someone else carted out some coolers filled with Schlitz and Narragansett, and the air turned fat with the smell of grilled hot dogs and Italian sausage, the wafting, smoky, charred smell and the whiff of open beer cans making Jimmy think of Fenway Park and summer Sundays and that tight joy you got in your chest when the adults kicked back and acted more like kids, everyone laughing, everyone looking younger and lighter and happy to be around each other.

---
EXAMPLE 7:
This was what Jimmy, even in the pit of his blackest hates after a beating from the old man or the theft of something he'd cared about— this was what he loved about growing up here. It was the way people could suddenly throw off a year of aches and complaints and split lips and job worries and old grudges and just let loose, like nothing bad had ever happened in their lives. On St. Pat's or Buckingham Day, sometimes on the Fourth of July, or when the Sox were playing well in September, or, like now, when something collectively lost had been found— especially then— this neighborhood could erupt into a kind of furious delirium. Not like up in the Point. In the Point they had block parties, sure, but they were always planned, the necessary permits obtained, everyone making sure everyone else was careful around the cars, careful on the lawns— Watch it, I just painted that fence. In the Flats, half the people didn't have lawns, and the fences sagged, so what the fuck. When you wanted to party, you partied, because, shit, you sure as hell deserved it. No bosses here today. No welfare investigators or loan shark muscle. And as for the cops— well, there were the cops now, partying along with everyone else, Officer Kubiaki helping himself to a hot'n'-spicy sausage spuckie off the grill, and his partner pocketing a beer for later. The reporters had all gone home and the sun was starting to set, giving the street that time-for-dinner glow, but none of the women were cooking, and no one was going inside. Except for Dave. Dave was gone, Jimmy realized when he stepped out of the hydrant spray and squeezed out his pant cuffs and put his T-shirt back on as he waited in line for a hot dog.

---
EXAMPLE 8:
The brothers grew up crammed and mangy and irate in a bedroom the size of a Japanese radio beside the el tracks that used to hover over the Flats, blotting out the sun, before they got torn down when Brendan was a kid. The floors in the apartment sloped hard to the east, and the trains hammered past the brothers' window twenty-one out of twenty-four hours each and every goddamned day, shaking the piece-of-shit three-decker so hard that most times the brothers fell out of bed and woke in the morning piled on top of one another, greeted the morning as irritable as waterfront rats, and pummeled the piss out of one another to clear the pile and start the day. When they were kids, they had no individuality to the outside world. They were just the Savages, a brood, a pack, a collection of limbs and armpits and knees and tangled hair that seemed to move in a cloud of dust like the Tasmanian Devil. You saw the cloud coming your way, you stepped aside, hoped they'd find someone else to fuck up before they reached you, or simply whirl on by, lost in the obsession of their own grimy psychoses. Hell, until Brendan had started dating Katie on the sly, he wasn't positive just how many of them there actually were, and he'd grown up in the Flats. Katie laid it out for him, though: Nick was the oldest, gone from the neighborhood six years to serve ten minimum at Walpole; Val was the next and, according to Katie, the sweetest; then came Chuck, Kevin, Al (who usually got confused with Val), Gerard, just fresh from Walpole himself, and finally, Scott, the baby boy and mother's favorite when she'd been alive, who was also the only one with a college degree, and the only one who didn't live at home in the first- and third-floor apartments the brothers had commandeered after they'd successfully scared the previous tenants to another state.

---
EXAMPLE 9:
*** STANDING ATOP the church steps, Jimmy could just make out the Penitentiary Channel. It was a stripe of dull purple on the far side of the expressway overpass, the park that abutted it serving as the only evidence of green on this side of the channel. Jimmy spied the white sliver top of the drive-in movie screen in the center of the park peeking just above the overpass. It still stood, long after the state had grabbed the land for short money at the Chapter Eleven auction and turned it over to the Parks and Recreation Service. Parks and Recreation spent the next decade beautifying the place, ripping up the poles that supported the car speakers, leveling and greening the land, cutting bike paths and jogging paths along the water, erecting a fenced-in garden co-op, even building a boathouse and ramp for canoers who couldn't get very far before they were turned back at either end by the harbor locks. The screen stayed, though, ended up sprouting from the edge of a cul-de-sac they'd created by planting a stand of already-formed trees shipped in from Northern California. Summers, a local theater group performed Shakespeare in front of the screen, painting medieval backdrops on it and skipping back and forth across the stage with tinfoil swords, saying "Hark" and "Forsooth" and shit like that all the time. Jimmy had gone there with Annabeth and the girls two summers back, and Annabeth, Nadine, and Sara had all nodded off before the end of the first act. But Katie had stayed awake, leaning forward on the blanket, elbow on her knee, chin on the heel of her hand, so Jimmy had too. They did The Taming of the Shrew that night, and Jimmy couldn't follow most of it— something about a guy slapping his fiancée into line until she became an acceptable servant wife, Jimmy failing to see the art in that but figuring he was losing a lot in the translation.

---
EXAMPLE 10:
Just about anything but that. 9 FROGMEN IN THE PEN THE FIRST THING Jimmy saw as he neared the Roseclair Street entrance to Pen Park was a K-9 van parked down on Sydney Street, its back doors open, two cops struggling with six German shepherds on long leather leashes. He'd walked up Roseclair from the church, trying hard not to trot, and reached a small crowd of onlookers by the overpass that stretched above Sydney. They stood at the base of the incline where Roseclair began its rise under the expressway and then over the Pen Channel, losing its name on the other side and becoming Valenz Boulevard as it left Buckingham and entered Shawmut. Back where the crowd had gathered, you could stand at the top of a fifteen-foot retaining wall of poured concrete that served as Sydney's dead end and look down on the last street running north-south in the East Bucky Flats, a rusting guardrail pressed against your kneecaps. Just a few yards east of the overlook, the guardrail gave way to a purple limestone stairwell. As kids, they'd sometimes bring dates there, and sit in the shadows passing forty-ounce bottles of Miller back and forth and watching the images flicker across the white screen of Hurley's Drive-in. Sometimes, Dave Boyle would come with them, not because anyone particularly liked Dave, but because he'd seen just about every damn movie ever made, and sometimes, if they were stoned, they'd have Dave rattle off the lines as they watched the silent screen, Dave getting into it so much at times that he even changed his vocal inflections to fit the various characters. Then Dave suddenly got good at baseball, went off to Don Bosco to become a jock superstar, and they couldn't keep him around just for laughs anymore.

---
EXAMPLE 11:
When Jimmy had first picked up the glove and walked away with it, he'd felt elated. He'd felt great. A little later, as they were crossing Buckingham Avenue, he'd felt that familiar shame and embarrassment that came whenever he stole something, an anger at whatever or whoever made him do these things. Then a little later, as they walked down Crescent and into the Flats, he felt a stab of pride as he looked at the shitty three-deckers and then the glove in his hand. Jimmy took the glove and he felt bad about it. Sean would miss it. Jimmy took the glove and he felt good about it. Sean would miss it. Jimmy watched his father stumble ahead of him, the old fuck looking like he'd crumple and turn into a puddle of himself any second, and he hated Sean. He hated Sean and he'd been dumb to think they could have been friends, and he knew he'd hold on to this glove for the rest of his life, take care of it, never show it to anyone, and he'd never, not once, use the goddamn thing. He'd die before that happened. Jimmy looked at the Flats spread out before him as he and the old man walked under the deep shade of the el tracks and neared the place where Crescent bottomed out and the freight trains rumbled past the old, ratty drive-in and the Penitentiary Channel beyond, and he knew— deep, deep in his chest— that they'd never see Dave Boyle again. Where Jimmy lived, on Rester, they stole things all the time. Jimmy had had his Big Wheel stolen when he was four, his bike when he was eight. The old man had lost a car. And his mother had started hanging clothes inside to dry after so many had been ripped off the line in the backyard.

---
EXAMPLE 12:
And if that bad man really was dead, the police would want to find out who did it. And if the trail actually led here, to Dave, they'd need evidence. She could see them sitting at the kitchen table, notebooks open, smelling of coffee and the previous night's taverns, asking her and Dave questions. They'd be polite, but scary. And she and Dave would be polite back and unruffled. Because it all came down to evidence. And she'd just washed the evidence down the kitchen sink drain and out into the dark sewers. In the morning, she'd remove the drainpipe from under the sink and wash that, too, douse the insides with bleach and put it back in place. She'd put the shirt and jeans into a plastic trash bag and hide it until Tuesday morning and then toss it into the back of the garbage truck where it would be mashed and chewed and compacted with rotten eggs and spoiled chickens and stale bread. She'd do this and feel large, better, than herself. "It makes you feel alone," Dave said. "What's that?" "Hurting someone," he said softly. "But you had to." He nodded. His flesh was gray in the semidark of the kitchen. He looked younger still, as if fresh from his mother's belly and gasping. "I know. I do. But still, it makes you feel alone. It makes you feel…" She touched his face and his Adam's apple bulged as he swallowed. "Alien," he said. 5 ORANGE CURTAINS SUNDAY MORNING AT SIX, four and a half hours before his daughter Nadine's First Communion, Jimmy Marcus got a call from Pete Gilibiowski down at the store telling him he was already in the weeds. "The weeds?" Jimmy sat up in bed, looked over at the clock. "Friggin' Pete, it's six in the morning.

---
EXAMPLE 13:
Loved the wife and two kids, forgot to remove the lift ticket from his parka during wintertime, active in his church, fiscally and socially conservative. But what the bland voice and bland face couldn't begin to hint at was the mind— a dense, unquestioning combination of the practical and the moralistic. You committed a capital crime in Martin Friel's jurisdiction— and it was his, fuck you if you didn't get that— and he took it very, very personally. "I want you sharp and I want you edgy," he'd said to Sean his first day in the Homicide Unit. "I don't want you overtly outraged, because outrage is emotion and emotion should never be overt. But I want you pretty fucking annoyed at all times— annoyed that the chairs here are too hard and all your friends from college are driving Audis. I want you annoyed that all perps are so dumb they think they can do their heinous shit in our jurisdiction. Annoyed enough, Devine, that you stay on the details of your cases so they don't get the ADAs blown out of court because of nebulous warrants and lack of probable cause. Annoyed enough to close every case clean and ram these nasty bastards into nasty cell blocks for the rest of their nasty fucking lives." Around the barracks it was called "Friel's Spiel," and every new trooper to the unit got it on day one in exactly the same way. Like most of the things Friel said, you had no idea how much he believed and how much was just rah-rah-law-enforcement shtick. But you bought it. Or you washed out. Sean had been in the State Police Homicide Unit two years, during which time he'd amassed the best clearance rate of anyone in Whitey Powers's squad, and Friel still looked at him sometimes like he wasn't sure about him.

---
EXAMPLE 14:
He opened the fridge and took out a beer, sat on the counter to drink it, the noise and lights of the evening banging around inside his skull, making him wonder if he'd finally gotten too old for this, if he was just too tired of death and dumb motives and dumb perps, the soiled-wrapper feeling of it all. Lately, though, he'd just been tired in general. Tired of people. Tired of books and TV and the nightly news and songs on the radio that sounded exactly like other songs on the radio he'd heard years before and hadn't liked much in the first place. He was tired of his clothes and tired of his hair and tired of other people's clothes and other people's hair. He was tired of wishing things made sense. Tired of office politics and who was screwing who, both figuratively and otherwise. He'd gotten to a point where he was pretty sure he'd heard everything anyone had to say on any given subject and so it seemed he spent his days listening to old recordings of things that hadn't seemed fresh the first time he'd heard them. Maybe he was simply tired of life, of the absolute effort it took to get up every goddamned morning and walk out into the same fucking day with only slight variations in the weather and the food. Too tired to care about one dead girl because there'd be another after her. And another. And sending the killers off to jail— even if you got them life— didn't yield the appropriate level of satisfaction anymore, because they were just going home, to the place they'd been heading all their dumb, ridiculous lives, and the dead were still dead. And the robbed and the raped were still the robbed and the raped.

---
EXAMPLE 15:
He wondered if this was what clinical depression felt like, a total numbness, a weary lack of hope. Katie Marcus was dead, yes. A tragedy. He understood that intellectually, but he couldn't feel it. She was just another body, just another broken light. And his marriage, too, what was that if not shattered glass? Jesus Christ, he loved her, but they were as opposite as two people could get and still be considered part of the same species. Lauren was into theater and books and films Sean couldn't understand whether they had subtitles or not. She was chatty and emotional and loved to string words together in dizzying tiers that climbed and climbed toward some tower of language that lost Sean somewhere on the third floor. He'd first seen her onstage in college, playing the dumped girl in some adolescent farce, no one in the audience for one second believing that any man would discard a woman so radiant with energy, so on fire with everything— experience, appetite, curiosity. They'd made an odd couple even then— Sean quiet and practical and always reserved unless he was with her, and Lauren the only child of aging-hipster liberals who'd taken her all over the globe as they worked for the Peace Corps, filled her blood with a need to see and touch and investigate the best in people. She fit in the theater world, first as a college actress, then as a director in local black-box houses, and eventually as a stage manager of larger traveling shows. It wasn't the travel, though, that overextended their marriage. Hell, Sean still wasn't sure what had done it, though he suspected it had something to do with him and his silences, the gradual dawn of contempt every cop grew into— a contempt for people, really, an inability to believe in higher motives and altruism.

## CONSISTENCY VERIFICATION

### ESTABLISHED FACTS (Never contradict)


### YOUR CONSISTENCY RESPONSIBILITIES
1. MANDATORY threads above must be visibly addressed in dialogue or action
2. NEVER contradict established character names, relationships, or timeline facts
3. Setting tone: modern city with hidden fantasy layer (no Tolkien-style elements)
4. Respect player's path personality and previous decision consequences

## ENGAGEMENT GUIDANCE FOR THIS CHAPTER


### SUBCHAPTER A ROLE
- This is the OPENING of the chapter
- Establish atmosphere and continue from the previous choice
- Plant the seeds of this chapter's conflict
- Hook: End with a question or complication that demands continuation


</engagement_guidance>


<task>
Based on all the context provided above (story_bible, story_context, active_threads, scene_state, engagement_guidance), write subchapter 1.1 (Opening/Hook (A)).

Before writing, plan:
1. What narrative threads from ACTIVE_THREADS must be addressed?
2. What is the emotional anchor for this subchapter?
3. How does this advance the chapter beat (Opening/Hook (A))?

## CURRENT TASK

Write **Chapter 1, Subchapter 1 (A)**

### STORY POSITION
- Chapter 1 of 12 (11 remaining)
- Subchapter 1 of 3
- Current path: "ROOT"
- Phase: RISING ACTION

### CHAPTER BEAT TYPE: INCITING_INCIDENT (MANDATORY)
**The impossible arrives: Jack receives a letter he wrote but did not write, leading to a photo with living ink**

This chapter MUST include:
- Continue from the dead letter discovery and silver glyph photo
- Jack investigates the impossible: the ink, the glyph, Victoria, The Threshold
- Build mystery without providing easy answers
- Establish the uncanny tone: things that should not exist, do
- End 1C with a decision that sets the investigation direction for Chapter 2

### PLAYER PATH PERSONALITY (CRITICAL FOR CONSISTENCY)
Based on player's choices, Jack's behavior pattern is: **Jack balances intuition with evidence**
- Dialogue tone should be adapts to the situation
- Risk tolerance: moderate


**IMPORTANT:** Jack's actions and dialogue MUST reflect this established personality pattern.

**BALANCED JACK VOICE NOTE:**
Jack adapts his approach to the situation. He can be patient when it serves him, aggressive when pushed. Match the narrative moment—if stakes are high and time is short, he acts; if information is needed, he investigates.

### DECISION CONSEQUENCES (Must be reflected in narrative)
- No previous decisions yet

### ONGOING EFFECTS FROM CHOICES
- Starting fresh

### MOST RECENT PLAYER DECISION (This MUST drive this subchapter)
- None (start of story)

### PACING REQUIREMENTS
- Continue establishing the mystery
- Introduce new suspects or complications
- Jack should be actively investigating
- Build relationships with allies/adversaries
- Plant seeds for later revelations

### WRITING REQUIREMENTS
1. **PLAN FIRST:** Use the 'beatSheet' field to outline 3-5 major beats.
2. **MINIMUM 850 WORDS** - AIM FOR 900+ WORDS. Write generously. Do NOT stop short.
3. Continue DIRECTLY from where the last subchapter ended
4. Maintain third-person limited voice throughout (no first-person narration)
5. Reference specific events from previous chapters (show continuity)
6. Include: atmospheric description, internal monologue, dialogue
7. Build tension appropriate to RISING ACTION phase
8. **ENSURE Jack's behavior matches the path personality above**
9. **FOLLOW the story arc and chapter outline guidance above**
</task>

<self_critique>
After generating your narrative, review it against these quality gates:

1. **Intent Alignment**: Did I answer the beat requirements, not just write prose?
2. **Thread Continuity**: Did I address at least 2 CRITICAL threads explicitly?
3. **Emotional Authenticity**: Is there a genuine gut-punch moment, not just plot?
4. **Timeline Precision**: Are all durations EXACT per ABSOLUTE_FACTS (never approximate)?
5. **Hook Quality**: Does the final line create unbearable forward momentum?
6. **Forbidden Patterns**: Did I avoid all forbidden phrases and constructions?

If any check fails, revise before returning your response.
