  `They streaked across the entrance road and joined the escort cars and moved en masse out onto Roseclair, an army of vehicles with screaming engines and screaming sirens screaming through the wind toward the expressway, screaming and screaming. *** SHE LAY on a metal table. Her eyes were closed and she was missing a shoe. Her skin was a black-purple, a shade Jimmy had never seen before. He could smell her perfume, just a hint of it through the reek of formaldehyde that permeated this cold, cold room. Sean put a hand against the small of Jimmy's back, and Jimmy spoke, barely feeling the words, certain that at this moment he was as dead as the body below him: "Yeah, that's her," he said. "That's Katie," he said. "That's my daughter." 13 LIGHTS "THERE'S A CAFETERIA UPSTAIRS," Sean said to Jimmy. "Why don't we go have some coffee?" Jimmy remained standing over his daughter's body. A sheet covered it again, and Jimmy lifted the upper corner of the sheet and looked down at his daughter's face as if peering at her from the top of a well and wanting to dive in after her. "They got a cafeteria in the same building as a morgue?" "Yeah. It's a big building." "Seems weird," Jimmy said, his voice stripped of color. "You think when the pathologists go in there, everybody else sits on the other side of the room?" Sean wondered if this was an early stage of shock. "I dunno, Jim." "Mr. Marcus," Whitey said, "we were hoping to ask you a few questions. I know this is a hard time, but…" Jimmy lowered the sheet back over his daughter's face, his lips moving, but no sounds leaving his mouth. He looked over at Whitey as if he were surprised to find him in the room, pen poised over his report pad.`,
  `It was as if, right at this moment, they were awakening from a dream life of their marriage and confronting against their wills all the rationalizations, halflies, submerged wants, and hidden selves they'd built it on. Watching it crumble under the wrecking-ball truth that they'd never known each other, they'd merely hoped they would someday. "The thing is, right?" Dave said. "The thing is, it's like I was saying about the vampires, Celeste. It's the same thing. The same goddamned thing." "What's the same thing?" she whispered. "It doesn't come out. Once it's in you, it stays." He was looking at the coffee table again and she could feel him fading away on her. She touched his arm. "Dave, what doesn't come out? What's the same thing?" Dave looked at her hand like he was going to sink his teeth into it with a snarl, rip it off at the wrist. "I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste. I'm warning you. I can't trust my mind." She removed her hand, and it tingled where it had touched his flesh. Dave stood up, wavering. He cocked his head and looked at her as if not sure who she was and how she'd gotten there on the edge of his couch. He looked over at the TV as James Woods fired that crossbow into someone's chest, and Dave whispered, "Blow 'em all away, Slayer. Blow 'em all away." He turned back to Celeste, gave her a drunken grin. "I'm going to go out." "Okay," she said. "I'm going to go out and think." "Yeah," Celeste said. "Sure." "If I can just get my head around this, I think it'll be all okay. I just need to get my head around it." Celeste didn't ask what "it" was. "So, okay then," he said, and walked to the front door.`,
  `We wash them clean." Dave sat down. He watched the blood leak out of him and onto his pants. It was pouring from him, and when he put his hand to his abdomen, his fingers touched a crevice that ran from one side to the other. He said, You lied. Jimmy bent down over him. "What?" You lied. "See his fucking lips moving?" Val said. "He's moving his lips." "I got eyes, Val." Dave felt the knowledge sweep over him then, and it was the ugliest knowledge he'd ever faced. It was mean and indifferent. It was callous, and it was merely this: I am dying. I cannot come back from this. I cannot cheat or slide away from this. I cannot beg my way out or hide behind my secrets. I cannot expect a reprieve based on sympathy. Sympathy from who? No one cares. No one cares. Except me. I care. I care a lot. And this isn't fair. I can't handle that tunnel alone. Please don't let me go there. Please wake me up. I want to wake up. I want to feel you, Celeste. I want to feel your arms. I'm not ready. He forced his eyes to focus as Val handed Jimmy something and Jimmy lowered it to Dave's forehead. It was cool. It was a circle of cool, of kindness and relief from the burning in his body. Wait! No. No, Jimmy! I know what that is. I can see the trigger. Don't, don't, don't, don't. Look at me. See me. Don't do this. Please. If you get me to a hospital I'll be all right. They'll fix me up. Oh God Jimmy don't you do that with your finger don't you do that I lied I lied please don't take me away from this please don't I can't prepare for a bullet in my brain.`,
  `In school, though, he was just the Boy Who Got Stolen, and everyone let their imaginations run as to what had happened during those four lost days. In the bathroom one morning, a seventh-grader named Junior McCaffery sidled up to the urinal beside Dave and said, "Did they make you suck it?" and all his seventh-grader friends had started laughing and making kissing noises. Dave zipped his fly with trembling fingers, his face red, and turned to face Junior McCaffery. He tried to put a mean look in his eyes, and Junior frowned and slapped him across the face. You could hear the sound of it echo in the bathroom. One seventh-grader gasped like a girl. Junior said, "You got something to say, queer? Huh? You want me to hit you again, faggot?" "He's crying," someone said. "He is," Junior McCaffery shrieked, and Dave's tears fell harder. He felt the numbness in his face turn into a sting, but it wasn't the pain that bothered him. Pain had never bothered him all that much, and he'd never cried from it, not even when he'd crashed his bike and sliced his ankle open on the pedal as he fell, and that had taken seven stitches to close. It was the range of emotions he could feel pouring from the boys in the bathroom that cut into him. Hate, disgust, anger, contempt. All directed at him. He didn't understand why. He'd never bothered anyone his whole life. Yet they hated him. And the hate made him feel orphaned. It made him feel putrid and guilty and tiny, and he wept because he didn't want to feel that way. They all laughed at his tears. Junior danced around for a moment, his face twisted up in rubbery contortions as he aped Dave's blubbering.`,
  `When Dave finally got it under control, reduced it to a few sniffles, Junior slapped him again, the same place, just as hard. "Look at me," Junior said as Dave felt a fresh burst of tears explode from his eye sockets. "Look at me." Dave looked up at Junior, hoping to see compassion or humanity or even pity— he'd take pity— in his face, but all he saw was an angry, laughing glare. "Yeah," Junior said, "you sucked it." He feinted another slap at Dave and Dave dropped his head and cringed, but Junior was walking away with his friends, all of them laughing as they left the bathroom. Dave remembered something Mr. Peters, a friend of his mother's who slept over occasionally, once said to him: "Two things you never take from a man— his spit or his slap. They're both worse than a punch, and a man does that to you, you try to kill him if you can." Dave sat down on the bathroom floor and wished he had that in himself — the will to kill someone. He'd start with Junior McCaffery, he supposed, and move on to Big Wolf and Greasy Wolf, if he ever ran into them again. But, truth was, he just didn't think he could. He didn't know why people were mean to other people. He didn't understand. He didn't understand. After the bathroom incident, word seemed to come down from on high or something and spread through the school, so that everyone from the third grade on up had heard about what Junior McCaffery did to Dave and how Dave had responded. A judgment was arrived at, and Dave found that even the few classmates who'd been his sort-of friends after he'd first returned to school started treating him like a leper.`,
  `"Jimmy," Annabeth said in the saddest voice Jimmy had ever heard come out of her. "Jimmy, please. Please." "Please what, honey?" Jimmy held her. "What?" "Oh, please, Jimmy. No. No." It was the noise— the sirens and screeching tires and yelling voices and echoing rotor blades. The noise was Katie, dead, screaming in their ears, and Annabeth was crumpling under it in Jimmy's arms. Dugay ran past them again and moved the sawhorses under the arch, and before Jimmy realized it had even moved, the cruiser was slamming to a stop beside him and a white van tore around it on the right and blew out onto Roseclair, took a hard left. Jimmy could see the words SUFFOLK COUNTY CORONER on the side of the van, and he felt all the joints in his body— his ankles, shoulders, knees, and hips— turn brittle and then liquefy. "Jimmy." Jimmy looked down at Sean Devine. Sean stared up at him through the open window of the passenger door. "Jimmy, come on. Please. Get in." Sean got out of the car and opened the rear door as the helicopter returned, higher this time, but still chopping the air close enough to Jimmy that he could feel it in his hair. "Mrs. Marcus," Sean said. "Jimmy, man. Get in the car." "Is she dead?" Annabeth said, and the words entered Jimmy and turned acidic. "Please, Mrs. Marcus. If you could get in the car." A phalanx of cruisers had formed a double escort line on Roseclair and their sirens raged. Annabeth screamed over the noise, "Is my daughter— ?" Jimmy moved her because he couldn't hear that word again. He pulled her through the noise and they climbed in the back of the car and Sean shut the door and climbed up front and the cop behind the wheel hit the gas and the sirens at the same time.`,
