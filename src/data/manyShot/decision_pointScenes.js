  `He couldn't be brave to that. He'd beg. He would. He'd do anything they wanted if they just didn't kill him. "I think you got in that car twenty-five years ago, Dave, and someone else came back in your place. I think your brain got fried or something," Jimmy said. "She was nineteen. You know? Nineteen and she never did nothing to you. She actually liked you. And you fucking killed her? Why? Because your life sucks? Because beauty hurts you? Because I didn't get in that car? Why? Just tell me that, Dave. Tell me that. Tell me that," Jimmy said, "and I'll let you live." "Fuck no," Val said. "Jimmy? No. Come on. You're feeling pity for this fucking turd? Listen— " "Shut up, Val," Jimmy said, pointing across the tar at him. "I handed you a fucking machine when I went in the joint and you ran it into the ground. Everything I gave you, and the best you can do is run muscle and sell fucking drugs? Don't you give me advice, Val. Don't you fucking think of doing that." Val turned away, kicked at the weeds, talking fast to himself in a whisper. "Tell me, Dave. But don't give me that child-molester bullshit because we're not purchasing bullshit tonight. Okay? Tell me the truth. If you tell me the lie again, I'll open you the fuck up." Jimmy took a few breaths. He held the knife up in front of Dave's face and then he lowered it and slid it between his belt and pants over his right hip. He held his empty hands wide. "Dave, I will give you your life. You just tell me why you killed her. You'll go to jail. I ain't bullshitting you there. But you'll live. You'll breathe." Dave felt so grateful he wanted to thank God aloud.`,
  `She'd asked him if crime was in his blood, and Jimmy had convinced her that it wasn't, because he'd thought that was the answer she was looking for. Only now, twelve and a half years later, did he understand that all she'd wanted from him was the truth. Whatever his answer had been, she would have adapted to it. She would have supported it. She would have built their lives accordingly. "We are not weak," she said, and Jimmy felt the desire take hold in him as if it had been building since birth. If he could've eaten her alive without causing her pain, he would have devoured her organs, sunk his teeth into her throat. "We will never be weak." She sat on the kitchen table, her legs dangling off the side. Jimmy looked at his wife as he stepped out of his pants, aware that this was temporary, that he was merely blocking the pain of Dave's murder, ducking from it into his wife's strength and flesh. But that would do for tonight. Maybe not tomorrow or in the days to come. But definitely for tonight, it would provide. And wasn't that how all recoveries started? With small steps? Annabeth placed her hands on his hips, her nails digging into the flesh near his spine. "When we're done, Jim?" "Yeah?" Jimmy felt drunk with her. "Make sure you kiss the girls good night." Epilogue JIMMY FLATS Sunday 28 WE'LL SAVE YOU A PLACE JIMMY WOKE UP Sunday morning to the distant sound of drums. Not the rat-a-tat and cymbal clash of some nose-ring band in a sweaty club, but the deep, steady, tom-tom thump of a war party encamped just on the outskirts of the neighborhood. Then he heard the bleat of brass horns, sudden and off-key. Once again, it was a distant sound, riding the morning air from a distance of ten or twelve blocks away, and it died almost as soon as it had started.`,
  `"What?" "Driving a car." "Yeah," Sean said slowly. "You know"— Jimmy held his palms out, the twig and cement forgotten — "just around the block." "Just around the block," Sean said. "It would be cool, wouldn't it?" Jimmy grinned. Sean felt a smile curl up and break wide across his face. "It would be cool." "It would be, like, cooler'n anything." Jimmy jumped a foot off the ground. He raised his eyebrows at Sean and jumped again. "It'd be cool." Sean could already feel the big wheel in his hand. "Yeah, yeah, yeah." Jimmy punched Sean's shoulder. "Yeah, yeah, yeah." Sean punched Jimmy's shoulder, something rippling inside him, racing, everything getting fast and shiny. "Yeah, yeah, yeah," Dave said, but his punch missed Jimmy's shoulder. For a moment, Sean had even forgotten Dave was there. That happened a lot with Dave. Sean didn't know why. "Fucking serious fucking cool." Jimmy laughed and jumped again. And Sean could see it was already beginning to happen. They were in the front seat (Dave in the back, if he was there at all) and moving, two elevenyear-olds driving around Buckingham, tooting the horn at their friends, drag-racing the older kids on Dunboy Avenue, laying rubber in screeching clouds of smoke. He could smell the air rushing through the window, feel it in his hair. Jimmy looked up the street. "You know anyone on this street who leaves their keys in their car?" Sean did. Mr. Griffin left them under the seat, and Dottie Fiore left them in her glove compartment, and Old Man Makowski, the drunk who listened to Sinatra records too loud all hours of the day and night, left them in the ignition most times. But as he followed Jimmy's gaze and picked out the cars that he knew held keys, Sean felt a dull ache grow behind his eyes, and in the hard sunlight bouncing off the trunks and hoods, he could feel the weight of the street, its homes, the entire Point and its expectations for him.`,
  `He was not a kid who stole cars. He was a kid who'd go to college someday, make something of himself that was bigger and better than a foreman or a truck loader. That was the plan, and Sean believed that plans worked out if you were careful, if you were cautious. It was like sitting through a movie, no matter how boring or confusing, until the end. Because at the end, sometimes things were explained or the ending itself was cool enough that you felt like sitting through all the boring stuff had been worth it. He almost said this to Jimmy, but Jimmy was already moving up the street, looking in car windows, Dave running alongside him. "How about this one?" Jimmy put his hand on Mr. Carlton's Bel Air, and his voice was loud in the dry breeze. "Hey, Jimmy?" Sean walked toward him. "Maybe some other time. Right?" Jimmy's face went all saggy and narrow. "What do you mean? We'll do it. It'll be fun. Fucking cool. Remember?" "Fucking cool," Dave said. "We can't even see over the dashboard." "Phone books." Jimmy smiled in the sunlight. "We'll get 'em from your house." "Phone books," Dave said. "Yeah!" Sean held out his arms. "No. Come on." Jimmy's smile died. He looked at Sean's arms as if he wanted to cut them off at the elbows. "Why won't you just do something for fun. Huh?" He tugged on the handle of the Bel Air, but it was locked. For a second, Jimmy's cheeks jiggled and his lower lip trembled, and then he looked in Sean's face with a wild loneliness that Sean pitied. Dave looked at Jimmy and then at Sean. His arm shot out awkwardly and hit Sean's shoulder. "Yeah, how come you don't want to do fun things?" Sean couldn't believe Dave had just hit him.`,
  `Dave, she'd come to believe, needed his lies, needed to rewrite his history and fashion it in such a way that it became something he could live with and tuck far away. And if it made him a better person— a loving, if occasionally distant, husband and attentive father— who was to judge? But this lie, Celeste knew as she tossed on some jeans and one of Dave's shirts, could bury him. Bury them, now that she had joined in the conspiracy to obstruct justice by washing the clothes. If Dave didn't come clean with her, she couldn't help him. And when the police came (and they would; this wasn't TV; the dumbest, drunkest detective was smarter than either of them when it came to crime), they'd break Dave's story like an egg on the side of a pan. *** DAVE'S RIGHT HAND was killing him. The knuckles had ballooned to twice their normal size and the bones closest to the wrist felt like they were ready to punch up through the skin. He could have forgiven himself, then, for floating meatballs to Michael, but he refused to. If the kid couldn't hit curves and knucklers from a Wiffle ball, he'd never be able to track a hardball coming twice as fast, hit it with a bat about ten times as heavy. His son was small for seven, and far too trusting for this world. You could see it in the openness of his face, the glow of hope in the set of his blue eyes. Dave loved that in his son, but he hated it, too. He didn't know if he had the strength to take it away, but he knew that soon he'd have to, or the world would do it for him. That tender, breakable thing in his son was a Boyle curse, the same thing that made Dave, at thirty-five, repeatedly get mistaken for a college student, find himself getting carded at liquor stores outside the neighborhood.`,
  `Sean had no idea where the words came from. He wasn't even aware he was speaking until he heard the sound of his voice enter the cold cafeteria: "We'll speak for her, Mrs. Marcus. If that's okay, we'll do that." Annabeth's face crinkled momentarily, and then she sucked at the air and nodded several times, wavering slightly against her husband. "Yes, Mr. Devine, that's okay. That's fine." *** DRIVING BACK across the city, Whitey said, "What's this car business?" Sean said, "What?" "Marcus said you guys almost got in some car when you were kids." "We…" Sean reached up by the dashboard and adjusted the side-view mirror until he could see the stream of headlights glowing behind them, fuzzy yellow dots bouncing slightly in the night, shimmying. "We, shit, well, there was this car. Me and Jimmy and a kid named Dave Boyle were playing out in front of my house. We were, like, eleven. And anyway, this car came up the street and took Dave away." "An abduction?" Sean nodded, keeping his eyes on those shimmying yellow lights. "Guys pretended to be cops. They convinced Dave to get in the car. Jimmy and me didn't. They had Dave four days. He managed to escape. Lives in the Flats now." "They catch the guys?" "One died, the other got busted about a year later, went the noose route in his cell." "Man," Whitey said, "I wish there was an island, you know? Like in that old Steve McQueen movie where he was supposed to be French and everyone had an accent but him? He's just Steve McQueen with a French name. Jumps off the cliff at the end with the raft made of coconuts? You ever see that?" "No." "Good movie. But, like, if they had an island just for baby-rapers and chicken hawks?`,
  `Give in to what he'd been feeling for the last decade at least. Yes, the Boy said. Do it. But (and this is where Dave's brain always split in half) he knew deep in his soul that this would be the worst sin of all. He knew it would be crossing a line— no matter how inviting— from which he could never come back. He knew that if he crossed that line, he'd never be able to feel whole, that he might just as well have stayed in that basement with Henry and George for the rest of his life. He would tell himself this in times of temptation, passing school bus stops and playgrounds, public swimming pools in the summer. He would tell himself that he was not going to become Henry and George. He was better than that. He was raising a son. He loved his wife. He would be strong. This was what he told himself more and more every year. But that wasn't helping Saturday night. Saturday night, the urge was as strong as he'd ever felt it. The red-haired kid leaning against the light pole seemed to know this. He smiled around his cigarette at Dave, and Dave felt tugged toward the curb. He felt as if he stood barefoot on a slope made of satin. And then a car had pulled up across the street, and after some talk, the kid had climbed in after giving Dave a pitying glance over the hood. Dave had watched the car, a two-toned, midnight-blue-and-white Cadillac, pull across the avenue and come toward him into the rear of the Last Drop's parking lot. Dave climbed into his car, and the Cadillac pulled back by the overgrown trees that spilled over the sagging fence. The driver shut off the lights but left the engine running, and the Boy had whispered in his ear: Henry and George, Henry and George, Henry and George… Tonight, before he could reach the Last Drop, Dave turned around even though the Boy was screaming in his ears.`,
  `That hadn't figured into her plans. She'd seen herself placing Michael in the passenger seat and their bags in the backseat and driving the three miles to the Econo Lodge along the expressway. "Shit," she said aloud, and resisted the urge to scream. "Mommy?" Michael mumbled. "It's okay, Mike." And maybe it was, because she looked back up to see a cab turning off Perthshire onto Buckingham Avenue. Celeste raised the hand that held Michael's bag, and the cab pulled over right in front of her, Celeste thinking she could spare the six bucks for a ride to the Econo Lodge. She could spare a hundred if it got her out of here right now, far enough away to think things through without having to watch for the turn of a doorknob and the return of a man who may have already decided she was a vampire, worthy only of a stake through her heart followed by a swift beheading, just to be sure. "Where you going?" the cabbie said as Celeste put her bags on the seat and slid in beside them with Michael on her shoulder. Anywhere, she wanted to say. Anywhere but here. IV GENTRIFICATION 22 THE HUNTING FISH "YOU TOWED his car?" Sean said. "His car was towed," Whitey said. "Not the same thing." As they pulled out of the morning rush-hour traffic and down onto the East Buckingham exit ramp, Sean said, "For what kind of cause?" "It was abandoned," Whitey said, whistling lightly through his teeth as he turned onto Roseclair. "Where?" Sean said. "In front of the man's house?" "Oh, no," Whitey said. "The car was found down in Rome Basin along the parkway. Lucky for us the parkway's State jurisdiction, ain't it? Appears someone jacked it, took it for a joyride, then abandoned it.`,
  `If she were going to do this, actually do it, she had to get out of her chair now and approach them. She stood, her legs trembling, and her hand hit the underside of the table. She looked down at it. Trembling, too, and the skin scraped along the lower half of the thumb bone. She raised it to her lips and then turned toward the door. She still wasn't sure she could do this, say the words that she'd prepared in the motel room this morning. She'd decided to tell Jimmy only what she knew— the physical details of Dave's behavior since early Sunday morning without any conclusions as to what they meant — and allow him to make his own judgments. Without the clothes Dave had worn home that night, it didn't make much sense to go to the police. She told herself this. She told herself this because she wasn't sure the police could protect her. She had to live in this neighborhood, after all, and the only thing that could protect you from something dangerous in the neighborhood was the neighborhood itself. And if she told Jimmy, then not only he, but the Savages as well, could form a kind of moat around her that Dave would never dare cross. She went through the door as Jimmy and Val neared their front steps. She raised her sore hand. She called Jimmy's name as she stepped into the avenue, looking like a crazy woman, she was sure— hair wild, eyes puffy and black with fear. "Hey, Jimmy! Val!" They turned as they reached the bottom step and looked over at her. Jimmy gave her a small, bewildered smile, and she noticed again what an open, lovely thing his smile was. It was unforced and strong and genuine.`,
  `"You can't." Connolly looked back at Sean, wide-eyed, because the kid was right. Technically, they couldn't lock him up unless they charged him. And they had nothing to charge him with, really. It was against the law in this state to charge anyone with suspicion. But Brendan didn't know any of that, and Sean gave Connolly a look that said: Welcome to Homicide, new boy. Sean said, "You don't tell me something right now, kid, I'm doing it." Brendan opened his mouth, and Sean saw a dark knowledge pass through him like an electric eel. Then his mouth closed, and he shook his head. "Suspicion of capital murder," Sean said to Connolly. "Jail his ass." *** DAVE GOT BACK to his empty apartment in the midafternoon and went straight to the fridge for a beer. He hadn't eaten anything and his stomach felt hollow and bubbling with air. Not the best conditions under which to throw back a beer, but Dave needed one. He needed to soften the edge in his head and take the crimps out of his neck, ease the wild-rat banging of his heart. The first one went down easy as he walked around the empty apartment. Celeste could have come home while he was gone and then went off to work, and he thought of calling Ozma's to see if she was in there now, cutting heads and chatting with the ladies, flirting with Paolo, the gay guy who worked the same shifts as she did and flirted in that loose but not entirely harmless way gay men did. Or maybe he'd go down to Michael's school, give him a big wave and a hug, then walk him back toward home, stop for chocolate milk on the way. But Michael wasn't in school and Celeste wasn't at work.`,
  `In fact, now that Ray's son was in jail, fuck it, he could stop sending the money. Use it for something good. The neighborhood, he decided. He'd use it to protect his neighborhood. And looking in the mirror, he decided that that's exactly what it was: his. From now on, he owned it. He'd been living a lie for thirteen years, pretending to think like a straight citizen, when all around him he saw the waste of blown opportunities. They were going to build a stadium down here? Fine. Let's talk about the workers we represent. No? Oh, okay. Better keep a close eye on your machinery, boys. Hate to have a fire on something like this. He'd have to sit down with Val and Kevin and discuss their future. This town was waiting to be opened up. And Bobby O'Donnell? His future, Jimmy decided, wasn't looking all that bright if he planned on sticking around East Bucky. He finished shaving, looked one more time at his reflection. He was evil? So be it. He could live with it because he had love in his heart and he had certainty. As trade-offs went, it wasn't half bad. He got dressed. He walked through the kitchen feeling like the man he'd been pretending to be all these years had just gone down the drain in the bathroom. He could hear his daughters shrieking and laughing, probably getting licked to death by Val's cat, and he thought, Man, that's a beautiful sound. *** OUT ON THE STREET, Sean and Lauren found a space in front of Nate &amp; Nancy's coffee shop. Nora slept in her carriage and they placed it in the shade under the awning. They leaned against the wall and ate their ice cream cones and Sean looked at his wife and wondered if they'd make it, or if the yearlong rift had done too much damage, squandered their love and all the good years they'd had in their marriage before the mess of the final two.`,
