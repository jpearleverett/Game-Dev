  `His father picked some stray nails up off the counter and placed them in a yellow coffee can. "I know you like Jimmy Marcus, but if you two want to play together from now on, you'll do it in view of the house. Yours, not his." Sean nodded. Arguing with his father was pointless when he spoke as quietly and slowly as he was doing now, every word coming out of his mouth as if it had a small stone attached to it. "We understand each other?" His father pushed the coffee can to his right, looked down at Sean. Sean nodded. He watched his father's thick fingers rub sawdust off the tips. "For how long?" His father reached up and pulled a wisp of dust off a hook embedded in the ceiling. He kneaded it between his fingers, then tossed it in the wastebasket under the counter. "Oh, a good while, I'd say. And Sean?" "Yes, sir?" "Don't be thinking about going to your mother on this one. She never wants you to see Jimmy again after that stunt today." "He's not that bad. He's— " "Didn't say he was. He's just wild, and your mother's had her fill of wild in her life." Sean saw something glint in his father's face when he said "wild," and he knew it was the other Billy Devine he was seeing for a moment, the one he'd had to build out of scraps of conversation he'd overheard from aunts and uncles. The Old Billy they called him, the "scrapper," his uncle Colm said once with a smile, the Billy Devine who'd disappeared sometime before Sean was born to be replaced by this quiet, careful man with thick, nimble fingers who built too many birdhouses. "You remember what we talked about," his father said, and patted Sean's shoulder in dismissal.`,
  `He put one hand under the shower spray, the rest of him still turned back toward her. "Okay. Look…" "What?" "You all right with this?" "Yeah." Hepatitis A, B, and C, she thought. Ebola. Hot zones. His eyes went wide again. "I might have killed someone, honey. Jesus." She wanted to go to him and touch him. She wanted to get out of the room. She wanted to caress his neck, tell him it would be okay. She wanted to run away until she could think this through. She stayed where she was. "I'll wash the clothes." "Okay," he said. "Yeah." She found some plastic gloves under the sink, ones she used when cleaning the toilet, and she put them on and checked for any tears in the rubber. When she was satisfied there were none, she took his shirt from the sink and his jeans off the floor. The jeans were dark with blood, too, and left a smear on the white tile. "How'd you get it on your jeans?" "What?" "The blood." He looked at them hanging from her hand. He looked at the floor. "I was kneeling over him." He shrugged. "I dunno. I guess it splashed up, like on the shirt." "Oh." He met her eyes. "Yeah. Oh." "So," she said. "So." "So, I'll wash these in the kitchen sink." "Okay." "Okay," she said, and backed out of the bathroom, left him standing there, one hand fluttering under the water, waiting for it to get hot. In the kitchen, she dumped the clothes in the sink and ran the water, watched the blood and filmy chips of flesh and, oh Christ, pieces of brain, she was pretty sure, wash down the drain. It amazed her how much the human body could bleed. They said you had six pints in you, but to Celeste it always seemed like so much more.`,
  `"Nineteen-year-old white girls getting murdered in my parks. People don't say 'Oh, the vagaries of economics' then. They don't feel a wistful sense of the tragic. They feel pissed and they want somebody to be led onto the six o'clock in shackles." Friel nudged Sean. "I mean, right?" "Right." "That's what they want, because they're us and that's what we want." Friel grasped Sean's shoulder so he'd look at him. "Yes, sir," Sean said, because Friel had that weird light in his eyes like he believed what he was saying the way some people believed in God or NASDAQ or the Internet-as-global-village. Friel was Born Again all the way, although what the Again had been Sean couldn't say, just that Friel had found something through his work that Sean could barely recognize, something that gave solace, maybe even belief, a certainty underfoot. Times, to be truthful, Sean thought his boss was an idiot, spouting bullshit platitudes about life and death and the ways to make it all right, cure the cancers and become one collective heart, if only everyone would listen. Other times, though, Friel reminded Sean of his father, building his birdhouses in the basement where no birds ever flew, and Sean loved the idea of him. Martin Friel had been Homicide Detective Lieutenant of Barracks Six going back a couple of presidents, and as far as Sean knew, no one had ever called him "Marty" or "buddy" or "old man." To look at him on the street, you would have guessed he was an accountant or maybe a claims adjuster for an insurance agency, something like that. He had a bland voice to go with his bland face, and nothing but a brown horseshoe remained of his hair. He was a small guy, particularly for a guy who'd worked his way up through the state trooper ranks, and you could lose him easily in a crowd because there was nothing distinctive to his walk.`,
  `What about your pal, though? He's a slim guy." "Who?" "Boyle." Sean came off the counter. "How'd we get to him?" "We're getting to him now." "No, wait a sec— " Whitey held up a hand. "He says he left the bar around one? Bullshit. Those car keys stopped that fucking clock at ten of. Katherine Marcus left that bar at twelve-forty-five. That's solid, Sean. This guy's alibi's got a fifteen-minute gap that we know of. How do we know when he got home? I mean, really got home?" Sean laughed. "Whitey, he's just a guy who was in the bar." "The last place she went. The last place, Sean. You said it yourself." "What'd I say?" "We could be looking for a guy who stayed home on prom night." "I was— " "I'm not saying he did this, man. I'm not even in the ballpark of saying that. Yet. But there is something wrong about the guy. I mean, you heard that shit about this city needing a good fucking crime wave. He was serious about that shit." Sean put his empty Coke on top of the kitchen counter. "You recycle?" Whitey frowned. "No." "Not even for a nickel a can?" "Sean." Sean tossed the can in the wastebasket. "You're telling me that you think a guy like Dave Boyle would kill his wife's— what?— second cousin because he's pissed about gentrification? That's the stupidest thing I ever heard." "I busted a guy once killed his wife because she gave him shit about his cooking." "But that's a marriage, man. That's shit building up between two people for years. You're talking about a guy saying. 'Damn, these rents are killing me. I should go kill a few people until they drop back to normal.'" Whitey laughed. "What?" Sean said.`,
  `Dave, who you used to play with in the backyard. That kid?" "I think anyone's capable of anything." "So, I could have done it." His father put a hand to his chest. "Or your mother." "No." "Better check our alibis." "I didn't say that. Jesus." "Sure you did. You said anyone was capable of anything." "Within reason." "Oh," his father said loudly. "Well, I didn't hear that part." He was doing it again— wrapping Sean up in knots, playing him like Sean played suspects in the box. No wonder Sean was so good at interrogation. He'd learned from a master. They sat in silence for a bit, and eventually his father said, "Hey, maybe you're right." Sean looked at him, waited for the punch line. "Maybe Dave could have done what you think. I dunno. I'm just remembering the kid. I don't know the man." Sean tried to see himself through his father's eyes then. He wondered if that's what his father saw— the kid, not the man— when he looked at his son. Probably hard to do otherwise. He remembered the way his uncles used to talk about his father, the youngest brother in a family of twelve who'd emigrated from Ireland when his father was five. The "old Bill," they'd say, referring to the Bill Devine who'd existed before Sean was born. The "scrapper." Only now could Sean hear their voices and feel the hint of patronization an older generation feels for a younger, most of Sean's uncles having a good twelve or fifteen years on their baby brother. They were all dead now. All eleven of his father's brothers and sisters. And here was the baby of the family, closing in on seventy-five, and holed up here in the suburbs by a golf course he'd never use.`,
  `His eyes were clear, his mouth closed, and he'd pulled his knees up by his chest. He rested his arms on them and she could feel a fierce and belligerent intelligence coming from him, his mind beginning to work far faster and with more originality than most people would muster in a lifetime. "The clothes he wore are gone," he said. She nodded. "I checked. Yeah." He placed his chin on his knees. "How scared are you? Honestly." Celeste cleared her throat. "Last night, Jimmy, I thought he was going to bite me. And then just keep biting." Jimmy tilted his face so that his left cheek rested on his knees now, and he closed his eyes. "Celeste," he whispered. "Yes?" "Do you think Dave killed Katie?" Celeste felt the answer rumble up through her body like last night's vomit. She felt its hot feet pound across her heart. "Yes," she said. Jimmy's eyes snapped open. Celeste said, "Jimmy? God help me." *** SEAN LOOKED ACROSS his desk at Brendan Harris. The kid looked confused and tired and scared, just the way Sean wanted him. He'd sent two troopers over to pick him up at his house and bring him back down here, and then he'd let Brendan sit on the other side of his desk while he scrolled down his computer screen and studied all the data he'd amassed on the kid's father, taking his time about it, ignoring Brendan, letting him sit there and fidget. He looked back at the screen now, tapped the scroll-down key with his pencil simply for effect, and said, "Tell me about your father, Brendan." "What?" "Your father. Raymond senior. You remember him?" "Barely. I was, like, six when he bailed on us." "So you don't remember the guy." Brendan shrugged. "I remember little things.`,
  `"I wanted to say something back to him. I wanted to say I loved my wife and she died and I hold you responsible and, besides, on general principle, you never rat out your friends if you want to live a long life. But I didn't say anything, Dave. I was crying too hard. That's how pathetic it was. He was blubbering, I was blubbering. I could barely see him." "So why'd you kill him?" Dave said, and there was a desperate keen in his voice. "I just told you," Jimmy said, like he was explaining himself to a fouryear-old. "Principle. I was a twenty-two-year-old widower with a five-yearold daughter. I'd missed the last two years of my wife's life. And fucking Ray, he damn well knew rule number one of our business— you don't rat out your friends." Dave said, "What is it you think I did, Jimmy? Tell me." "When I killed Ray," Jimmy said, "I felt, I dunno, I felt the complete lack of myself. I felt like God was staring down at me as I weighted him down and rolled him into that water. And God was just shaking his head. Not mad, really. He was just disgusted but not all that surprised, I guess, the way you'd get when a puppy shits on your rug. I stood right there behind where you're standing now, and I watched Ray sink, you know? His head going under last, and I remember thinking how when I was a kid I used to think that if you swam to the bottom of any body of water, you'd push through the floor and your head would pop out into space. I mean, that's how I pictured the globe, you know? So there I'd be, my head sticking out of the globe, and all that space and stars and black sky around me, and I'd just fall.`,
  `Call me Sean. It's okay." She shook his hand. Her palm was clammy, her fingers hot, and she let go almost as soon as they'd touched. Sean said, "This is Lauren, my wife." "Hello," Lauren said. "Hi." For a moment, no one knew what to say. They stood there, stilted and untethered, and then Celeste looked across the street and Sean followed her gaze to Jimmy, standing there with his arm around Annabeth, the two of them shining as bright as the day, surrounded by friends and family. They looked like they'd never lose anything again. Jimmy's eyes swept past Celeste and met Sean's. He nodded in recognition and Sean nodded back. Celeste said, "He killed my husband." Sean felt Lauren freeze up against him. "I know," he said. "I can't prove it yet, but I know." "Will you?" "What?" "Prove it?" she said. "I'll try, Celeste. I swear to God." Celeste looked out on the avenue and scratched her head with a lazy ferocity, as if digging for lice. "I can't seem to put a finger on my mind lately." She laughed. "That didn't sound right. But I can't. I just can't." Sean reached out and touched her wrist. She looked at him, her brown eyes wild and aged. She seemed sure he was going to slap her. He said, "I can give you the name of a doctor, Celeste, someone who specializes in those who've lost loved ones to violent crime." She nodded, though his words didn't seem to provide any consolation. Her wrist fell away from his hand, and she tugged at her fingers again. She noticed Lauren watching her, and she looked down at her fingers. She dropped her hands, then raised them again and crossed her arms over her chest and tucked her hands under her elbows as if trying to keep them from flying away.`,
  `They'd heard this one, like, a thousand times. "Because it can!" Dave Boyle shrieked, and grabbed his gut like it was so funny it hurt. Jimmy walked over to the sawhorses, where city crews had been replacing several squares of sidewalk. The work crews had tied yellow CAUTION tape to four sawhorses in a rectangle, created a barricade around the new sidewalk squares, but Jimmy snapped the tape by walking through it. He squatted at the edge, his Keds on the old sidewalk, and used a twig on the soft pavement to carve thin lines that reminded Sean of old men's fingers. "My dad don't work with yours anymore." "How come?" Sean squatted by Jimmy. He didn't have a stick, but he wanted one. He wanted to do what Jimmy did, even if he didn't know why, and even though his father would strap his ass if he did. Jimmy shrugged. "He was smarter than them. He scared them because he knew so much stuff." "Smart stuff!" Dave Boyle said. "Right, Jimmy?" Right, Jimmy? Right, Jimmy? Dave was like a parrot some days. Sean wondered how much anyone could know about candy and why that information would be important. "What kind of stuff?" "How to run the place better." Jimmy didn't sound real sure and then he shrugged. "Stuff, anyway. Important stuff." "Oh." "How to run the place. Right, Jimmy?" Jimmy dug in the cement some more. Dave Boyle found his own stick and bent over the soft cement, began drawing a circle. Jimmy frowned and tossed his own stick aside. Dave stopped drawing, looked at Jimmy like, What'd I do? "Know what would be cool?" Jimmy's voice had that slight rise in it that made something in Sean's blood jitter, probably because Jimmy's idea of cool was usually way different than anyone else's.`,
  `His mother followed Jimmy's gaze and when she looked back at him, she was worn out again, the smile gone so completely from her face, you'd have been surprised she knew how to make one. "Hey, Jim." He loved it when she called him "Jim." It made him feel like they were in on something together. "Yeah?" "I'm real glad you didn't get in that car, baby." She kissed his forehead and Jimmy could see her eyes glistening, and then she stood up and walked over to some of the other mothers, kept her back to her husband. Jimmy looked up and saw Dave in the window staring down at him again, a soft yellow light on somewhere in the room behind him now. This time, Jimmy didn't even try to wave back. With the police and reporters all gone now, and the party so deep in swing no one probably remembered what had started it, Jimmy could feel Dave in that apartment, alone except for his crazy mother, surrounded by brown walls and weak yellow lights as the party throbbed on the street below. And he was glad, too, once again, that he hadn't gotten in that car. Damaged goods. That's what Jimmy's father had said to his mother last night: "Even if they find him alive, the kid's damaged goods. Never be the same." Dave raised a single hand. He held it up by his shoulder and didn't move it for a long time, and as Jimmy waved back, he felt a sadness weed its way into him and go deep and then spread out in small waves. He didn't know whether the sadness had something to do with his father, his mother, Miss Powell, this place, or Dave holding that hand so steady as he stood in the window, but whatever caused it— one of those things or all of them— it would never, he was sure, come back out again.`,
  `The second thing he said to Sean, almost as an afterthought, when he was halfway out the door: "They caught one of them, Sean." "What?" "One of the guys who took Dave. They caught him. He's dead. Suicide in his cell." "Yeah?" His father looked back at him. "Yeah. You can stop having nightmares now." But Sean said, "What about the other one?" "The guy who got caught," his father said, "he told the police the other one was dead, too. Died in a car accident last year. Okay?" His father looked at him in such a way that Sean knew this was the last discussion they'd have on the subject. "So wash up for dinner, pal." His father left and Sean sat on his bed, the mattress lumpy where he'd placed his new baseball glove, a ball wrapped inside, thick red rubber bands wrapped tightly around the leather. The other one had died, too. In a car wreck. Sean hoped he'd been driving the car that had smelled of apples, and that he'd driven it off a cliff, took that car straight down to hell with him. II SAD-EYED SINATRAS (2000) 3 TEARS IN HER HAIR BRENDAN HARRIS LOVED Katie Marcus like crazy, loved her like movie love, with an orchestra booming through his blood and flooding his ears. He loved her waking up, going to bed, loved her all day and every second in between. Brendan Harris would love Katie Marcus fat and ugly. He'd love her with bad skin and no breasts and thick fuzz on her upper lip. He'd love her toothless. He'd love her bald. Katie. The trill of her name sliding through his brain was enough to make Brendan feel like his limbs were filled with nitrous oxide, like he could walk on water and bench-press an eighteen-wheeler, toss it across the street when he was finished with it.`,
  `Hear me? One thing in the whole world that gives you pleasure. Mine was busting your bastard father's balls every chance I got." Her eyes gleamed and spittle dotted her lips. "Trust me, after a while? He loved it." Celeste wiped her mother's forehead with a towel. She smiled down on her and said, "Momma," in a soft, cooing voice. She dabbed the spittle from her lips and stroked the inside of her hand, all the time thinking, I've got to get out of here. Out of this house, out of this neighborhood, out of this crazy place where people's brains rotted straight through from being too poor and too pissed off and too helpless to do anything about it for too fucking long. Her mother kept living, though. She survived colitis, diabetic seizures, renal failure, two myocardial infarctions, cancerous malignancies in one breast and her colon. Her pancreas stopped working one day, just quit, then suddenly showed back up for work a week later, raring to go, and doctors repeatedly asked Celeste if they could study her mother's body after she died. The first few times, Celeste had asked, "Which part?" "All of it." Rosemary Savage Samarco had a brother in the Flats she hated, two sisters living in Florida who wouldn't talk to her, and she'd busted her husband's balls so successfully he dove into an early grave to escape her. Celeste was her only child after eight miscarriages. When she was little, Celeste used to imagine all those almost-sisters and almost-brothers floating around Limbo and think, You caught a break. When Celeste had been a teenager, she'd been sure someone would come along to take her away from all this. She wasn't bad-looking. She wasn't bitter, had a good personality, knew how to laugh. She figured, all things considered, it should happen.`,
  `He seemed shocked to find her there. He jumped back when she stood up. She said, "Honey, what happened?" and reached for him. He jumped back again and his foot hit the doorjamb. "I got sliced." "What?" "I got sliced." "Dave, Jesus Christ. What happened?" He lifted the shirt and Celeste stared at a long sweeping gash along his rib cage that bubbled red. "Sweetie, Jesus, you have to go to the hospital." "No, no," he said. "Look, it's not that deep. It just bled like hell." He was right. On a second look, she noticed it wasn't more than a tenth of an inch deep. But it was long. And it was bloody. Though not enough to account for all the blood on his shirt and neck. "Who did this?" "Some crackhead nigger psycho," he said, and peeled off the shirt, dumped it in the sink. "Honey, I fucked up." "You what? How?" He looked at her, eyes spinning. "The guy tried to mug me, right? So, so I swung on him. That's when he sliced me." "You swung on a guy with a knife, Dave?" He ran the faucet and tipped his head into the sink, gulped some water. "I don't know why. I freaked. I mean, I freaked seriously, babe. I fucked this guy up." "You…?" "I mangled him, Celeste. I just went apeshit when I felt the knife in my side. You know? I knocked him down, got on top of him, and, baby, I went off." "So it was self-defense?" He made a "sorta-kinda" gesture with his hand. "I don't think the court would see it that way, tell you the truth." "I can't believe this. Honey"— she took his wrists in her hands— "tell me exactly what happened." And for a quarter second, looking into his face, she felt nauseous.`,
  `She felt something leering behind his eyes, something turned on and selfcongratulatory. It was the light, she decided, the cheap fluorescent directly above his head, because when his chin dipped toward his chest and he stroked her hands, the nausea went away and his face returned to normal— scared, but normal. "I'm walking to my car," he said, and Celeste sat back on the closed toilet seat as he knelt in front of her, "and this guy comes up to me, asks me for a light. I say I don't smoke. Guy says neither does he." "Neither does he." Dave nodded. "So, my heart starts clocking a buck-fifty right then. 'Cause there's no one around but me and him. And that's when I see the knife and he says. 'Your wallet or your life, bitch. I'm leaving with one of 'em.'" "That's what he said?" Dave leaned back, cocked his head. "Why?" "Nothing." Celeste thinking it just sounded funny for some reason, too clever maybe, like in the movies. But then everyone saw movies these days, more so now with cable, so maybe the mugger had learned his lines from a movie mugger, stayed up late at night saying them into a mirror until he thought he sounded like Wesley or Denzel. "So…so then," Dave said, "I'm like, 'Come on, man. Just let me get in my car and go home,' which was dumb because now he wants my car keys, too. And I just, I dunno, honey, I get mad instead of scared. Whiskey-brave, maybe, I'm not sure, and I try to brush past him and that's when he slices me." "I thought you said he swung on you." "Celeste, can I tell the fucking story?" She touched his cheek. "I'm sorry, baby." He kissed her palm. "So, yeah, he sorta pushes me back against the car and takes a swing at me and I, like, just duck the punch and that's when Homeboy slices me, and I feel the knife cutting through my skin and I, I just flip.`,
  `She did the same with the jeans, and by that time Dave was out of the shower and sitting at the kitchen table with a towel wrapped around his waist, smoking one of the long white cigarettes her mother had left behind in the cupboard and drinking a beer, watching her. "Fucked up," he said softly. She nodded. "I mean, you know?" he whispered. "You go out, expecting one thing, a Saturday night, nice weather, and then…" He stood and came over by her, leaned against the oven, and watched her wring out the left leg of his jeans. "Why aren't you using the washing machine in the pantry?" She looked over at him and noticed the cut along his side already going a puckered white after the shower. She felt a nervous need to giggle. She swallowed against it and said, "Evidence, sweetie." "Evidence?" "Well, I dunno for sure, but I figure blood and…other stuff have a better chance of sticking to the insides of a washing machine than to a sink drain." He let out a low whistle. "Evidence." "Evidence," she said, giving in to a grin now, feeling conspiratorial, dangerous, part of something big and worthwhile. "Damn, babe," he said. "You're a genius." She finished wringing out the jeans and shut off the water, took a small bow. Four in the morning, and she was more awake than she'd been in years. She was Christmas-morning-when-you're-eight kind of awake. Her blood was caffeine. Your whole life, you wished for something like this. You told yourself you didn't, but you did. To be involved in a drama. And not the drama of unpaid bills and minor, shrieking marital squabbles. No. This was real life, but bigger than real life. This was hyper-real. Her husband may have killed a bad man.`,
  `He's going to be sleeping? Bladder probably woke him up at four, he's been watching AMC ever since." "Shit." Annabeth pushed the sheets completely away from her and got out of bed. "Fucking Katie. She's going to screw this day up, too?" Jimmy felt his neck get hot. "What other day has she screwed up lately?" Annabeth showed him the back of her hand as she reached the bathroom. "You even know where she could be?" "Diane or Eve's," Jimmy said, still back at that dismissive hand she'd raised over her shoulder. Annabeth— the love of his life, no question— man, she had no idea how cold she could be sometimes, no clue (and this was typical of the whole Savage family) just how corrosive an effect her negative moments or moods could have on other people. "Maybe a boyfriend's." "Yeah? Who's she seeing these days?" Annabeth turned on the shower, stepped back to the sink to give it time to warm up. "I figured you knew better than me." Annabeth riffled the medicine cabinet for the toothpaste and shook her head. "She stopped seeing Little Caesar in November. That was good enough for me." Jimmy, putting his shoes on, smiled. Annabeth always called Bobby O'Donnell "Little Caesar" unless she was calling him something far worse, and not just because he was a gangster-wannabe with a cold stare, but because he was short and fleshy like Edward G. Robinson. Those had been a tense several months, when Katie had begun seeing him last summer and the Savage brothers told Jimmy they'd clip the prick if it became necessary, Jimmy not sure if they were morally repulsed because such a scumbag was seeing their beloved stepniece, or because Bobby O'Donnell had become too much competition. Katie had broken it off herself, though, and outside of a lot of 3 A.M.`,
  `Just flapping. They never do anything else. Flap, flap, flap. Hundreds of 'em in this big, big field. Flapping away…" He waited for more, but that was the extent of it, and he didn't want Marita to nod off in the middle of the conversation like she'd done several times before, so he said, "How's Katie?" "Huh?" "How's Katie doing, honey?" "Your mom takes good care of us. She's sad." "Who? My mom or Katie?" "Both. Lookit, Jimmy? I gotta go. Nauseous. Tired." "Okay, baby." "Love you." "Love you, too." "Jimmy? We never owned any orange curtains. Right?" "Right." "Weird," she said, and then she hung up. Last thing she ever said to him: Weird. Yeah, it was weird. A mole that had been on your arm since you'd lain in a crib looking up at a cardboard mobile suddenly darkened, and twenty-four weeks later, almost two full years removed from the last time you'd lain in bed with your husband and curled your leg over his, you were dropped into a box and buried beneath the earth, your husband standing fifty yards away, flanked by armed guards, shackles clamped around his ankles and wrists. Jimmy got out of prison two months after the funeral, stood in his kitchen in the same clothes he'd left it in, and smiled at his alien child. He might have remembered her first four years, but she didn't. She only remembered the last two, maybe some scattered fragments of the man he'd been in this house, before she was allowed to see him only on Saturdays from the other side of an old table in a dank, smelly place built on haunted Indian burial grounds, where winds whipped and walls dripped and the ceilings hung too low. Standing in his kitchen, watching her watch him, Jimmy had never felt more useless.`,
  `"He's in his late seventies, man." "I know why he's slow," Pete said. "I'm just saying. That was me and him at eight o'clock, 'stead of me and you, Jim? Man, we'd still be in the weeds." "Which is why I put him on slow shifts. Anyway, it wasn't supposed to be me and you or you and Sal on this morning. It was supposed to be you and Katie." Brendan and Silent Ray had reached the counter and Jimmy saw something catch in Brendan's face when he said his daughter's name. Pete came off the cigarette rack and said, "That it, Brendan?" "I…I…I…" Brendan stammered, then looked at his little brother. "Ahm, I think so. Let me check with Ray." The hands went flying again, the two of them going so fast it would have been hard for Jimmy to keep up even if they were making sounds. Silent Ray's face, though, was as stone dead as his hands were electric and alive. He'd always been an eerie little kid, in Jimmy's opinion, more like the mother than the father, a blankness living in his face like an act of defiance. He'd mentioned it to Annabeth once and she'd accused him of being insensitive to the handicapped, but Jimmy didn't think that was it— something lived in Ray's dead face and silent mouth that you just wanted to beat out with a hammer. They finished flinging their hands back and forth and Brendan bent over the candy rack and came back with a Coleman Chew-Chew bar, making Jimmy think about his father again, the stench of him that year he'd worked the candy plant. "And a Globe, too," Brendan said. "Sure thing, kid," Pete said, and rang it up. "So's, ah, I thought Katie worked Sundays." Brendan handed Pete a tenspot.`,
  `Pete raised his eyebrows as he punched the cash key and the door popped open against his belly. "You sweet on my man's daughter, Brendan?" Brendan wouldn't look at Jimmy. "No, no, no." He laughed, and it died as soon as it left his mouth. "I was just wondering, you know, because usually I see her here." "Her little sister's having her First Communion today," Jimmy said. "Oh, Nadine?" Brendan looked at Jimmy, eyes too wide, smile too big. "Nadine," Jimmy said, curious as to how the name had come to Brendan so fast. "Yeah." "Well, tell her congrats from me and Ray." "Sure, Brendan." Brendan dropped his gaze to the counter and nodded several times as Pete bagged up the tea and candy bar. "So, yeah, okay, good seeing you guys. Come on, Ray." Ray hadn't been looking at his brother when he spoke, but he moved anyway, and Jimmy remembered once again the thing that people usually forgot about Ray: he wasn't deaf, just mute, few people around the neighborhood or otherwise, Jimmy was sure, having encountered one like that before. "Hey, Jimmy," Pete said when the brothers had gone, "I ask you something?" "Shoot." "Why you hate that kid so bad?" Jimmy shrugged. "I don't know if it's hate, man. It's just…Come on, you don't find that mute little fucker just a little spooky?" "Oh, him?" Pete said. "Yeah. He's a weird little shit, always staring like he sees something in your face he wants to pluck out. You know? But I wasn't talking about him. I was talking about Brendan. I mean, the kid seems nice enough. Shy but decent, you know? You notice how he uses sign language with his brother even though he don't have to? Kinda like he just wants the kid to feel he ain't alone.`,
  `It's nice. But, Jimmy, man, you look at him like you're two steps from slicing off his nose, man, feeding it to him." "No." "Yeah." "Really?" "Straight up." Jimmy looked out over the Lotto machine, past the dusty window onto Buckingham Avenue lying gray and damp under the morning sky. He felt Brendan Harris's shy goddamned smile in his blood, itching him. "Jimmy? I was just playing with you. I didn't mean nothing by— " "Here comes Sal," Jimmy said, and kept his eyes on the window, his head turned away from Pete as he watched the old man shuffle across the avenue toward them. "About fucking time, too." 6 BECAUSE IT'S BROKEN SEAN DEVINE'S SUNDAY— his first day back to work after a week's suspension— started when he was yanked from a dream, ripped out of it by the beep of an alarm clock followed by the seizure-realization, like a baby popping from the womb, that he'd never be allowed to go back in. He couldn't remember much of the specifics— just a few details, unconnected — and he had a sense that there hadn't been much of a narrative flow in the first place. Still, the raw texture of it had sunk like razor points into the back of his skull, left him feeling skittish all morning. His wife, Lauren, had been in it, and he could still smell her flesh. She'd had messy hair the color of wet sand, darker and longer than in life, and wore a damp white bathing suit. She was very tan and a light dusting of sand had speckled her bare ankles and the tops of her feet. She'd smelled of the sea and the sun, and she'd sat in Sean's lap and kissed his nose, tickled his throat with long fingers.`,
  `"'You stay away from them. Only thing in life I demand of you, Katie. Please.'" "So how'd it happen?" Brendan said. "You ending up with me?" She'd rolled over in his arms and smiled sadly at him. "You don't know?" Truth be told, Brendan didn't have a clue. Katie was Everything. A Goddess. Brendan was just, well, Brendan. "No, I don't know." "You're kind." "I am?" She nodded. "I see you with Ray or your mother and even everyday people on the street, and you're just so kind, Brendan." "A lotta people are kind." She shook her head. "A lot of people are nice. It's not the same thing." And Brendan, thinking about it, had to admit that his whole life he'd never met anyone who didn't like him— not in a popularity contest type of way, but in a basic "That Harris kid's all right" type of way. He'd never had enemies, hadn't been in a fight since grade school, and couldn't remember the last time he'd heard a harsh word directed his way. Maybe it was because he was kind. And maybe, like Katie said, that was rare. Or maybe he just wasn't the type of guy who made people mad. Well, except for Katie's father. That was a mystery. And there was no denying it for what it was: hate. Just half an hour ago, Brendan had felt it in Mr. Marcus's corner store— that quiet, coiled hatred emanating from the man like a viral infection. He'd wilted under it. He'd stammered because of it. He couldn't look at Ray the whole way home because of how that hatred had made him feel— unwashed, his hair filled with nits, teeth covered in grime. And the fact that it made no sense— Brendan had never done anything to Mr.`,
  `"Hey, bad boy." Whitey Powers's eyebrows rose in surprise. "Someone call you already?" "Yeah," Sean said. "I don't have a partner, though, Sarge. Adolph's out." Whitey Powers nodded. "You get your hand slapped and that useless kraut takes a sudden medical." He put his arm around Sean. "You're with me, kid. The duration of your probation." So that was how it was going to work, Whitey keeping watch on Sean until the department brass decided if he met their gold standard or not. "Was looking like a quiet weekend, too," Whitey said as he turned Sean toward the car with the open door. "Whole county last night, Sean? Quieter than a dead cat. Had a stabbing in Parker Hill, 'nother in Bromley Heath, and some college kid took a beating from a beer bottle over in Allston. None of them fatal, though, and all of them City's. Hell, the Parker Hill vic, right? Walked into the ER at MGH on his own, big ol' steak knife sticking out of his collarbone, asked the admitting nurse where they kept a Coke machine 'round this bitch." "She tell him?" Sean said. Whitey smiled. He was one of State Homicide's brightest boys and had been forever, so he smiled a lot. He must have taken the call heading into his shift, though, because he wore sweatpants and his son's hockey jersey, a baseball hat riding backward on his head, iridescent blue flip-flops over bare feet, his gold badge hanging from a nylon cord over the jersey. "Like the shirt," Sean said, and Whitey gave him another lazy grin as a bird broke overhead from the park and arced above them, letting loose a rattling caw that bit into Sean's spine. "Man, half an hour ago? I was on my sofa." "Watching cartoons?" "Wrestling." Whitey pointed at the weeds and the park beyond.`,
  `"I figure we'll find her over there somewhere. But, you know, we just started looking and Friel says we call it a Missing Persons till we find a body." The bird swung over them again, a little lower, that sharp rattle of a caw finding the base of Sean's brain this time and nibbling. "It's ours, though?" Sean said. Whitey nodded. "'Less the victim ran back out again, got snuffed somewhere down the block." Sean glanced up. The bird had a big head and short legs tucked under a white chest that was striped gray in the center. Sean didn't recognize the species, but then he didn't hang out in nature all that much. "What is it?" "A belted kingfisher," Whitey said. "Bullshit." He held up a hand. "Swear to God, man." "Watched a lot of Wild Kingdom as a kid, didn't you?" The bird let loose that hard rattle again and Sean wanted to shoot it. Whitey said, "Want to look at the car?" "You said 'her,'" Sean said as they ducked under yellow crime scene tape and headed for the car. "CSS found the reg in the glove box. Car's owner is a Katherine Marcus." "Shit," Sean said. "Know her?" "Might be the daughter of a guy I know." "You guys close?" Sean shook his head. "No, just to nod hello from around the neighborhood." "Sure?" Whitey was asking if he wanted to pass on the case right here, right now. "Yeah," Sean said. "Sure as shit." They reached the car and Whitey pointed at the open driver's door as a CSS tech stepped back from it and stretched, arching her back, hands entwined and thrust toward the sky. "Just don't touch nothing, guys. Who's the point on this?" Whitey said, "That'd be me. Park is State jurisdiction." "But the car's on city property." Whitey pointed at the weeds.`,
  `That he was out? That he'd make her rich? That he'd never commit a crime again? Annabeth had a calm, almost forgettable face from a distance, but when you got up close, you saw so many things in there that you didn't understand, a sense of a mind furiously at work, never sleeping. "I mean, dancing's in your blood, right?" "I dunno. I guess." "But now that you've been told you can't do it anymore, you've stopped, right? It might hurt, but you've faced it." "Okay…" "Okay," he said, and slid a cigarette out of the pack that lay on the stone bench between them. "So, yeah, I was good at what I did. But I took a pinch and my wife died and that fucked my daughter up." He lit the cigarette and took a long exhale as he tried to put it exactly as he'd said it in his mind a hundred times. "I ain't fucking my daughter up again, Annabeth. You know? She can't go through another two years of me doing time. My mother? She ain't a well woman. She dies while I'm locked down? Then they take my daughter, make her a ward of the state, put her in some sort of Deer Island for tots. I couldn't take that shit. So that's it. In the blood, out of the blood, whatever the fuck, I'm staying straight." Jimmy held her gaze as she studied his face. He could tell she was searching for flaws in his explanation, a whiff of bullshit, and he hoped he'd somehow managed to make the speech fly. He'd been working on it long enough, preparing for a moment like this. And, fact was, what he'd said was mostly true. He'd only left out that one thing he'd sworn to himself he'd never tell another soul, no matter who that soul was.`,
  `So he looked in Annabeth's eyes and waited for her to make her decision, and tried to ignore images from that night by the Mystic River— the guy on his knees, saliva dripping down his chin, the screech of his begging— images that kept trying to push their way into his head like drill bits. Annabeth took a cigarette. He lit it for her, and she said, "I used to have the worst crush on you. You know that?" Jimmy kept his head steady, his gaze calm, even though the relief flooding through him was like a jet blast— he'd sold the half-truth. If things worked out with Annabeth, he'd never have to sell it again. "No shit? You on me?" She nodded. "When you'd come by the house to see Val? My God, I was, what, fourteen, fifteen? Jimmy, forget it. My skin would start to buzz just hearing your voice in the kitchen." "Damn." He touched her arm. "It ain't buzzing now." "Oh, sure it is, Jimmy. Sure it is." And Jimmy felt the Mystic roll far away again, dissolve into the dirty depths of the Pen, gone from him, rolling off into the distance where it belonged. *** BY THE TIME Sean got back to the jogging trail, the CSS woman was there. Whitey Powers radioed all units on-scene to do a sweep-and-detain of any vagrants in the park and squatted down beside Sean and the CSS woman. "The blood heads that way," the CSS woman said, pointing deeper into the park. The jogging path went over a small wooden bridge and then curled off and down into a heavily wooded section of the park, circling around the old drive-in screen down at the far end. "There's more over there." She pointed with her pen, and Sean and Whitey looked back over their shoulders, saw smaller blood spatters in the grass on the other side of the joggers' path by the small wooden bridge, the leaves of a tall maple having protected the spatters from last night's rain.`,
  `Because once they got in there, they didn't like what they saw and they ran from it. "So what's up, honey?" "Oh, nothing." She wrapped her arms around herself, even though the day was warming up pretty fast. "Hey, Mike, did you eat?" "Not yet." Celeste frowned at Dave, like it was the crime of the century Michael hit a few balls before he got a sugar high from that crimson cereal he ate. "Your bowl's full and milk's on the table." "Good. I'm starving." Michael dropped the bat, and Dave felt a betrayal in the way he flipped the bat and hurried to the stairs. You were starving? And, what, I taped your mouth up so you couldn't tell me? Fuck. Michael trotted past his mother and then hit the stairs leading up to the third floor like they'd disappear if he didn't reach the top fast enough. "Skipping breakfast, Dave?" "Sleeping till noon, Celeste?" "It's ten-fifteen," Celeste said, and Dave could feel all the goodwill they'd pumped back into their marriage with last night's kitchen lunacy turn to smoke and drift off into the yards beyond theirs. He forced himself to smile. You made the smile real enough, no one could get past it. "So what's doing, hon?" Celeste came down into the yard, her bare feet a light brown on the grass. "What happened to the knife?" "What?" "The knife," she whispered, looking back over her shoulder at McAllister's bedroom window. "The one the mugger had. Where'd it go, Dave?" Dave tossed the ball in the air, caught it behind his back. "It's gone." "Gone?" She pursed her lips and looked down at the grass. "I mean, shit, Dave." "Shit what, honey?" "Gone where?" "Gone." "You're sure." Dave was sure. He smiled, looked in her eyes. "Positive." "Your blood's on it, though.`,
  `She'd placed the plate of runny eggs and black bacon and undercooked, soggy toast down in front of him and asked him if he wanted orange juice. "Ma," he said, "who were those guys? Why did they— ?" "Davey," she said, "you want orange juice? I didn't hear." "Sure. Look, Ma, I don't know why they took— " "There you go." Placing the juice in front of him. "Eat your breakfast and I'm going to…" She waved her hands at the kitchen, no idea what the fuck she was going to do. "I'm going to…wash your clothes. Okay? And, then, Davey? We'll go see a movie. How's that sound?" Dave looked at his mother, looked for something that was waiting for him to open his mouth and tell her, tell her about that car and the house in the woods, and the smell of the big one's aftershave. Instead he saw a bright, hard gaiety, the look she got sometimes as she was preparing to go out on Friday nights, trying to find just the right thing to wear, desperate with hope. Dave put his head down and ate his eggs. He heard his mother leave the kitchen, humming "Old MacDonald" all the way down the hall. Standing in the yard now, knuckles aching, he could hear it, too. Old MacDonald had a farm. And everything was hunky-dory on it. You farmed and tilled and reaped and sowed and everything was just fucking great. Everyone got along, even the chickens and the cows, and no one needed to talk about anything, because nothing bad ever happened, and nobody had any secrets because secrets were for bad people, people who didn't eat their eggs, people who climbed in cars that smelled of apples with strange men and disappeared for four days, only to come back home to find everyone they'd known had disappeared, too, been replaced with smiley-faced lookalikes who'd do just about anything but listen to you.`,
  `Martin Friel hoisted himself up onto the stage and sat there with his small legs dangling over the earth. He'd come here from the back nine at the George Wright and smelled of sunblock under his blue polo and khakis. He drummed his heels off the side of the stage, and Sean could feel a hint of moral annoyance in him. "You've worked with Sergeant Powers before, right?" "Yeah," Sean said. "Any problems?" "No." Sean watched Whitey take a uniformed trooper aside, point off to the stand of trees behind the drive-in screen. "I worked the Elizabeth Pitek homicide with him last year." "Woman with the restraining order?" Friel said. "Ex-husband said something about paper?" "Said, 'Paper rules her life, don't mean it rules mine.'" "He got twenty, right?" "Twenty solid, yeah." Sean wishing someone had gotten her a stronger piece of paper. Her kid growing up in a foster home, wondering what happened, who the fuck he belonged to now. The trooper walked away from Whitey, grabbed a few more uniforms, and they headed off for the trees. "Heard he drinks," Friel said, and pulled one leg up onto the stage with him, held the knee up against his chest. "I've never seen it on the clock, sir," Sean said, wondering who was really on probation in Friel's eyes, him or Whitey. He watched Whitey bend and peer at a clump of grass near the van's rear tire, pull up the cuff of his sweatpants as if he were wearing a Brooks Brothers suit. "Your partner's out on that bullshit disability claim, pulled something in his spine so he's recuperating on Jet Skis, parasailing in Florida, what I hear." Friel shrugged. "Powers requested you when you got back. Now you're back. We going to have any more incidents like the last one?" Sean had been expecting to eat shit, particularly from Friel, so he kept his voice perfectly contrite.`,
  `He turned his head, looked at Sean. "You ever think," Jimmy said, "how the most minor decision can change the entire direction of your life?" Sean held his eyes. "How so?" Jimmy's face was pale and blank, the eyes turned up as if he were trying to remember where he'd left his car keys. "I heard once that Hitler's mother almost aborted him but bailed at the last minute. I heard he left Vienna because he couldn't sell his paintings. He sells a painting, though, Sean? Or his mother actually aborts? The world's a way different place. You know? Or, like, say you miss your bus one morning, so you buy that second cup of coffee, buy a scratch ticket while you're at it. The scratch ticket hits. Suddenly you don't have to take the bus anymore. You drive to work in a Lincoln. But you get in a car crash and die. All because you missed your bus one day." Sean looked at Whitey. Whitey shrugged. "No," Jimmy said, "don't do that. Don't look at him like I'm crazy. I'm not crazy. I'm not in shock." "Okay, Jim." "I'm just saying there are threads, okay? Threads in our lives. You pull one, and everything else gets affected. Say it rained in Dallas and so Kennedy didn't ride in a convertible. Stalin stayed in the seminary. Say you and me, Sean, say we got in that car with Dave Boyle." "What?" Whitey said. "What car?" Sean held up a hand to him and said to Jimmy, "I'm losing you here." "You are? If we got in that car, life would have been a very different thing. My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother? She was so beautiful. She was regal. You know the way some Latin women can be? Gorgeous. And she knew it.`,
  `They're protective of Katie." "The Savages," Sean told Whitey. Whitey placed his pen on the pad again and pressed his index and thumb tips against the skin at the corners of his eyes. "The Savage brothers." "Yes. Why?" "All due respect, ma'am, I'm a bit worried this could shape up into something ugly." Whitey kept his head down, kneading the back of his neck now. "I mean absolutely no offense here, but— " "That's usually what someone says before they're about to say something offensive." Whitey looked up at her with a surprised smile. "Your brothers, you must know, have some reputations themselves." Annabeth met Whitey's smile with a hard one of her own. "I know what they are, Sergeant Powers. You don't have to dance around it." "A friend of mine in Major Crimes told me a few months back that O'Donnell was making noise about moving into loan-sharking and heroin. Both of which, I'm told, are exclusively Savage territory." "Not in the Flats." "What's that, ma'am?" "Not in the Flats," Jimmy said, his hand on his wife's. "Means they don't do that shit in their own neighborhood." "Just someone else's," Whitey said, and let that lie on the table for a bit. "In either case, that would leave a vacuum in the Flats. Right? An exploitable vacuum. Which, if my info is correct, is what Bobby O'Donnell has been planning to exploit." "And?" Jimmy said, rising up a bit in his seat. "And?" "And what does this have to do with my daughter, Sergeant?" "Everything," Whitey said, his arms spreading wide. "Everything, Mr. Marcus, because all either side needed was one little excuse to go to war. And now they have it." Jimmy shook his head, a bitter grin twitching at the edges of his mouth. "Oh, you don't think so, Mr.`,
  `Marcus?" Jimmy raised his head. "I think my neighborhood, Sergeant, is going to disappear soon. And crime's going to go with it. And it won't be because of the Savages or the O'Donnells or you guys bucking up against them. It'll be because interest rates are low and property taxes are getting high and everyone wants to move back to the city because the restaurants in the suburbs suck. And these people moving in, they aren't the kind that need heroin or six bars per block or ten-dollar blow jobs. Their lives are fine. They like their jobs. They got futures and IRAs and nice German cars. So when they move in— and they're coming— crime and half the neighborhood will move out. So I wouldn't worry much about Bobby O'Donnell and my brothers-in-law going to war, Sergeant. War for what?" "For the right now," Whitey said. Jimmy said, "You honestly think O'Donnell killed my daughter?" "I think the Savages might consider him a suspect. And I think someone needs to talk them out of that kind of thinking until we've had time to do our jobs." Jimmy and Annabeth sat on the other side of the table, Sean trying to read their faces but getting nothing back. "Jimmy," Sean said, "without distractions, we can close this case fast." "Yeah?" Jimmy said. "I got your word on that, Sean?" "You do. And close it clean, too, so nothing comes back on us in court." "How long?" "What?" "How long would you say it'll take you to put her killer in jail?" Whitey held up a hand. "Wait a second— are you bargaining with us, Mr. Marcus?" "Bargaining?" Jimmy's face had that convict's deadness to it again. "Yeah," Whitey said. "Because I'm perceiving— " "You're perceiving?" "— an aspect of threat to this conversation." "Really?" All innocence now, but the eyes still dead.`,
  `Just airlift food in a few times a week, fill the water with mines. No one gets off. First-time offenders, fuck you, you get life on the island. Sorry, fellas, just can't risk you getting out and poisoning someone else. 'Cause it's a transmittable disease, you know? You get it 'cause someone did it to you. And you go and pass it on. Like leprosy. I figure we put 'em all on this island, less chance they can pass it on. Each generation, we have fewer and fewer of them. A few hundred years, we turn the island into Club Med or something. Kids hear about these freaks the way they hear about ghosts now, as something we've, I dunno, evolved beyond." Sean said, "Shit, Sarge, what're you, deep all of a sudden?" Whitey grinned and turned onto the expressway ramp. "Your buddy Marcus," he said. "Moment I laid eyes on him, I knew he'd done time. They never lose that tension, you know? In their shoulders mostly. Spend two years watching your own back, every second of every day, the tension's gotta settle somewhere." "He just lost his daughter, man. Maybe that's what settled in his shoulders." Whitey shook his head. "No. That's in his stomach right now. You see how he kept grimacing? That's the loss sitting in his stomach, turning it to acid. Seen it a million times. The shoulders, though, that's prison." Sean turned from the rearview, watched the lights on the other side of the highway for a bit. They came in their direction like bullet eyes, streaked past them like hazy ribbons, blurring into one another. He felt the city girded all around them, with its high-rises and tenements and office towers and parking garages, arenas and nightclubs and churches, and he knew that if one of those lights went out, it wouldn't make any difference.`,
  `Show these men how good you play. Go get it." Whitey looked at Sean like he couldn't believe this shit. "Mrs. Harris," he said, "that won't be necessary." She lit another cigarette, the match head jumping with her rage. "All I ever did was feed him," she said. "Buy him clothes. Raise him." "Yes, ma'am," Whitey said as the front door opened and two kids came in with skateboards under their arms, both kids about twelve or so, maybe thirteen, one of them a dead ringer for Brendan— he had his good looks and dark hair, but there was something of the mother in his eyes, a spooky lack of focus. "Hey," the other kid said as they came into the kitchen. Like Brendan's brother, he seemed small for his age, and he'd been cursed with a face both long and sunken, a mean old man's face on a kid's body, peeking out from under stringy hanks of blond hair. Brendan Harris raised his hand. "Hey, Johnny. Sergeant Powers, Trooper Devine, this is my brother, Ray, and his friend, Johnny O'Shea." "Hey, boys," Whitey said. "Hey," Johnny O'Shea said. Ray nodded at them. "He don't speak," the mother said. "His father couldn't shut up, but his son don't speak. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair." Ray's hands signed something to Brendan, and Brendan said, "Yeah, they're here about Katie." Johnny O'Shea said, "We went to go 'boarding in the park. They got it closed." "It'll be open tomorrow," Whitey said. "Tomorrow's supposed to rain," the kid said as if it were their fault he couldn't skateboard at eleven o'clock on a school night, Sean wondering when parents started letting kids get away with so much shit. Whitey turned back to Brendan. "You think of any enemies she had? Anyone, besides Bobby O'Donnell, who might have been angry with her?" Brendan shook his head.`,
  `He could instantly picture it— a highway rest stop, the gas station up top, a bank of phones between the Roy Rogers and the McDonald's. Lauren standing there, listening. "Lauren," he said. "I know it's you." Someone passed by the pay phone jingling his keys. "Lauren, just say something." The tractor-trailer ground into first gear and the pitch of the engine changed as it rolled across the parking lot. "How is she?" Sean said. He almost said, "How is my daughter?" but, then, he didn't know if she was his, only that she was Lauren's. So, he said again, "How is she?" The truck shifted into second, the crush of its tires on gravel growing more distant as it headed for the mouth of the plaza and the road beyond. "This hurts too much," Sean said. "Can't you just talk to me?" He remembered what Whitey had said to Brendan Harris about love, how it doesn't happen even once to most people, and he could see his wife standing there, watching the truck depart, the phone pressed to her ear but not her mouth. She was a slim woman and tall, with hair the color of cherry wood. When she laughed, she covered her mouth with her fingers. In college, they'd run across campus in a rainstorm, and she kissed him for the first time under the library archway where they'd found shelter, and something had loosened in Sean's chest as her wet hand found the back of his neck, something that had been clenched and breathless since as long as he could remember. She told him that he had the most beautiful voice she'd ever heard, that it sounded like whiskey and wood smoke. Since she'd left, the usual ritual was that he'd talk until she decided to hang up.`,
  `"What's that?" Annabeth said, her eyes on the bacon crackling below her in a black pan. "You need anything?" Jimmy asked. "I can work the stove a bit, you want." Annabeth gave the stovetop a quick, weak smile and shook her head. "No, I'm fine." Jimmy looked at Celeste as if to say: Is she? Celeste nodded. "We've got things covered in here, Jim." Jimmy looked back over at his wife, and Celeste could feel the tenderest of aches in the look. She could feel another teardrop piece of Jimmy's heart detach and free-fall down the inside of his chest. He leaned in and reached across the stove and wiped a bead of sweat from Annabeth's cheekbone with his index finger, and Annabeth said, "Don't." "Look at me," Jimmy whispered. Celeste felt like she should leave the kitchen, but she feared her moving would snap something between her cousin and Jimmy, something too fragile. "I can't," Annabeth said. "Jimmy? If I look at you, I'll lose it, and I can't lose it with all these people here. Please?" Jimmy leaned back from the stove. "Okay, honey. Okay." Annabeth whispered, her head down, "I just don't want to lose it again." "I understand." For a moment, Celeste felt as if they stood naked before her, as if she were witness to something between a man and his wife that was as intimate as if she were watching them make love. The door at the other end of the hall opened, and Annabeth's father, Theo Savage, entered the house, came down the hall with a case of beer on each shoulder. He was a huge man, a florid, jowly Kodiak of a human being with an odd dancer's grace as he squeezed down the narrow hall with the cases of beer on his boat-mast shoulders.`,
  `"Seven kids," he'd said to Jimmy, "no more'n two years apart between any of 'em, all screaming their lungs out in that shitty apartment. People'd talk about the joys of childhood, right? I'd come home from work into all that noise and go, 'Fucking show me.' I didn't get no joy. Got a lot of headaches, though. Ton of those." Jimmy knew from Annabeth that when her father came home to those headaches, he usually only stuck around long enough to eat his dinner and go back out again. And Theo had told Jimmy that he'd never lost much sleep when it came to child rearing. He'd had mostly boys, and boys were simple in Theo's opinion— you fed them, taught them how to fight and play ball, and they were pretty much good to go. Any coddling they needed, they'd get from their mother, come to the old man when they needed money for a car or someone to post bail. It was the daughters you spoiled, he told Jimmy. "Is that what he called it?" Annabeth said when Jimmy mentioned it. Jimmy wouldn't have cared what kind of parent Theo had been if Theo didn't take every opportunity to weigh in on Jimmy and Annabeth's deficiencies as parents, tell them with a smile that no offense, mind you, but he wouldn't let a kid get away with that. Jimmy usually just nodded and said thanks and ignored him. Now Jimmy could see that wise-old-man gleam in Theo's eyes as Theo sat down in the chair across from him and looked down at the floor. He gave a rueful smile to the clamor of feet and voices from the apartment below. "Seems like you only see your family and friends at weddings and wakes. Don't it, Jim?" "Sure," Jimmy said, still trying to shake the feeling he'd had since four o'clock yesterday that his true self hovered above his body, treading air with slightly frantic strokes, trying to figure a way back in through his own skin before he got tired from all that flapping and sank like a stone to the black core of the earth.`,
  `Theo put his hands on his knees and looked at Jimmy until Jimmy raised his head and met his eyes. "How you handling this so far?" Jimmy shrugged. "It hasn't totally sunk in yet." "Gonna hurt like hell when it does, Jim." "I imagine." "Like hell. I can guarantee you that." Jimmy shrugged again and felt an inkling of some kind of emotion— was it anger?— bubble up from the pit of his stomach. This was what he needed right now: a pep talk on pain from Theo Savage. Shit. Theo leaned forward. "When my Janey died? Bless her soul, Jim, I was no good for six months. One day she was here, my beautiful wife, and the next day? Gone." He snapped his thick fingers. "God gained an angel that day, and I lost a saint. But my kids were all grown by then, thank Christ. I mean, I could afford to grieve for six months. I had that luxury. But you, though, you don't." Theo leaned back in his chair and Jimmy felt that bubbling sensation again. Janey Savage had died ten years ago, and Theo had climbed into a bottle for a lot more than six months. More like two years. It was the same bottle he'd been renting for most of his life, he just took out a mortgage after Janey passed away. When she'd been alive, Theo had paid Janey about as much attention as week-old bread. Jimmy tolerated Theo because he had to— he was his wife's father, after all. From the outside looking in, they probably seemed like friends. Maybe Theo thought they were. And age had mellowed Theo to the point that he openly loved his daughter and spoiled his grandkids. But it was one thing not to judge a guy for past sins.`,
  `It was another thing to take advice from him. "So, you see what I'm saying?" Theo said. "You make sure you don't let your grief become an indulgence, Jim, and, you know, pull you away from your domestic responsibilities." "My domestic responsibilities," Jimmy said. "Yeah. You know, you gotta take care of my daughter, those little girls. They got to be your priority now." "Uh-huh," Jimmy said. "You figured that might slip my mind, Theo?" "Ain't saying it would, Jim. Saying it could. That's all." Jimmy studied Theo's left kneecap, pictured it exploding in a puff of red. "Theo." "Yeah, Jim." Jimmy saw the other kneecap blow up and shifted to the elbows. "You think we could have waited on this conversation?" "No time like the present." Theo let loose his boom of a laugh, but there was a warning to it. "Tomorrow, say." Jimmy's gaze left Theo's elbows and rose to his eyes. "I mean, tomorrow would have been all right. Wouldn't it, Theo?" "What I say about the present, Jimmy?" Theo was getting annoyed. He was a big man with a violent temper and Jimmy knew that scared some people, that Theo could see the fear in faces on the street, that he'd grown accustomed to it and confused it with respect. "Hey, the way I look at it, there's no good time to have this conversation. Am I right? So I figured I'd just get it out of the way. ASAP, as it were." "Oh, sure," Jimmy said. "Hey, like you said, no time like the present. Right?" "Right. Good kid." Theo patted Jimmy's knee and stood up. "You'll get through this, Jimmy. You'll move on. You'll carry the pain, but you'll move on. 'Cause you're a man. I said to Annabeth— your wedding night?— I said, 'Honey, you got yourself a real old-school man there.`,
  `The perfect guy, I said. A champ. A guy who— '" "Like they put her in a bag," Jimmy said. "What's that?" Theo looked down at him. "That's what Katie looked like when I identified her in the morgue last night. Like someone had put her in a bag and beaten the bag with pipes." "Yeah, well, don't let it— " "Couldn't even tell what race she was, Theo. Coulda been black, coulda been Puerto Rican like her mother. Coulda been Arab. She didn't look white, though." Jimmy looked at his hands, clasped together between his knees, and noticed stains on the kitchen floor, a brown one by his left foot, mustard by the table leg. "Janey died in her sleep, Theo. All due respect and shit, but there you go. She went to bed, never woke up. Peaceful." "You don't need to talk about Janey. All right?" "My daughter, though? She was murdered. There's a bit of a difference." For a moment, the kitchen was silent— buzzing with silence, really, the way only an empty apartment can when the one below is filled with people — and Jimmy wondered if Theo would be dumb enough to keep talking. Come on, Theo, say something stupid. I'm in that kind of mood, like I need to take this bubbling inside of me and push it on somebody. Theo said, "Look, I understand," and Jimmy let loose a sigh through his nostrils. "I do. But, Jim, you don't have to get all— " "What?" Jimmy said. "I don't have to get all what? Someone put a gun to my daughter's flesh and blew the back of her head out, and you want to make sure I got my— my what?— my grief priorities straight? Please, tell me. Do I got that part right?`,
  `"Shit." Jimmy stretched his arms above his head and yawned. "You know people keep asking me that? I guess it's to be expected." He lowered his hands and shrugged. "It seems to shift, hour to hour. Right now? I'm doing okay. Could change, though. Probably will." He shrugged again and looked at Dave. "What happened to your hand?" Dave looked at it. He'd had all day to come up with an explanation, he'd just kept forgetting to. "This? I was helping a buddy move a couch into his place, slammed it against the doorjamb squeezing the couch up a staircase." Jimmy tilted his head and looked at the knuckles, the bruised flesh between the fingers. "Uh, okay." Dave could tell he wasn't sold, and he decided he'd need to come up with a better lie for the next person who asked. "One of those stupid things," Dave said. "The ways you can manage to hurt yourself, right?" Jimmy was looking into his face now, the hand forgotten, and Jimmy's features softening. He said, "It's good to see you, man." Dave almost said, Really? In the twenty-five years he'd known Jimmy, Dave could never remember a time he'd felt Jimmy was happy to see him. Sometimes, he'd felt Jimmy didn't mind seeing him, but that wasn't the same thing. Even after they'd rotated back into each other's lives when they'd married women who were first cousins, Jimmy had never once given an indication he could remember when he and Dave had been anything but the most casual of acquaintances. After a while, Dave had begun to accept Jimmy's version of their relationship as fact. They had never been friends. They had never played stickball and kickthe-can and 76 on Rester Street. They had never spent a year of Saturdays hanging with Sean Devine, playing war in the gravel pits off Harvest, jumping roof to roof from the industrial garages near Pope Park, watching Jaws together at the Charles, huddled down in their seats and screaming.`,
  `"He's a cop now. He's actually investigating Katie's…Well, he's working the case, I guess they call it." "Yeah," Dave said. "He dropped by my place." "He did?" Jimmy said. "Huh. What was he doing at your place, Dave?" Dave tried to make it sound offhand, casual. "I was in McGills Saturday night. Katie was there. I showed up on a list of people who were in the place." "Katie was there," Jimmy said, his eyes staring off the porch and growing small. "You saw Katie Saturday night, Dave? My Katie?" "I mean, yeah, Jim, I was in the place and so was she. And then she left with her two friends and— " "Diane and Eve?" "Yeah, those girls she was always hanging with. They left and that was it." "That was it," Jimmy said, staring far away. "Well, I mean, as far as I saw of her. But, you know, I was on a list." "You were on a list, right." Jimmy smiled, but not at Dave, at something he must have seen in that far-off gaze of his. "You talk to her at all that night?" "Katie? No, Jim. I was watching the game with Stanley the Giant. I just nodded hello, you know. Next time I looked up, she was gone." Jimmy sat silently for a bit, sucking up air through his nostrils and nodding to himself a few times. Eventually, he looked at Dave and smiled a broken smile. "It's nice." "What?" Dave said. "Sitting out here. Just sitting. It's nice." "Yeah?" "Just to sit and look out at the neighborhood," Jimmy said. "You're on the go your whole life with work and kids and, shit, except when you're sleeping, you hardly have any time to slow down. Today, right? An out-ofthe-ordinary day if ever there was one, but still I have to deal with details.`,
  `Sometimes, to hear him talk about her, you'd have to remind yourself they were divorced. He did it now as he led Sean into the living room and looked down at the Sega system on the floor as he unbuttoned his shirt. "Suzanne says me and Terry got ourselves a real guy's fantasy pad going here. Rolls her eyes, you know, but I get the feeling she's a little jealous. Beer or something?" Sean remembered what Friel had said about Whitey's drinking problem and imagined the look he'd get if he showed up for the meeting smelling like Altoids and Budweiser. Plus, knowing Whitey, it could be a test from him, too, everyone watching Sean these days. "Take a water," he said. "Or a Coke." "Good boy," Whitey said, smiling as if he really had been testing Sean but Sean seeing the need in the man's loose eyes, the way the tip of his tongue played against the corners of his mouth. "Two Cokes coming up." Whitey came back out of the kitchen with the two sodas and handed one to Sean. He walked into a small bathroom just off the living room hallway, and Sean heard him strip off the shirt and run some water. "This whole thing is looking more random," he called from the bathroom. "You getting that feeling?" "A bit," Sean admitted. "Fallow and O'Donnell's alibis look pretty solid." "Don't mean they couldn't have hired it out," Sean said. "I agree. You thinking that way, though?" "Not really. Seems too messy for a hit." "Don't rule it out, though." "No, it don't." "We'll need to take another run at the Harris kid, if only because he got no alibi, but, man, I don't see him for this. The kid's Jell-O, you know?" "Motive, though," Sean said, "if, say, he had some building jealousy of O'Donnell, something like that." Whitey came out of the bathroom, wiping his face with a towel, his white belly emblazoned with a red snake of scar tissue that cut a smile through the flesh from the lower edge of one side of his rib cage to the other.`,
  `"You put it that way," Whitey said. "Okay. It's dumb. Still, there's something about that guy. If he didn't have a hole in his alibi, I'd say okay. If he didn't see the victim an hour before she died, I'd say okay. But he does have a hole, and he did see her, and there's something off about the guy. He says he went right home? I want his wife to confirm that. I want his firstfloor neighbor to have heard him walking up the stairs at one-oh-five. You know? Then I'll forget about him. Did you notice his hand?" Sean didn't say anything. "His right hand was almost twice the size of his left. That guy got into something recently. I want to know what. Once I know it was just a beef down the bar, something like that, I'm good. I'll let it go." Whitey drained his second Coke and tossed it in the wastebasket. "Dave Boyle," Sean said. "You seriously want to take a look at Dave Boyle." "A look," Whitey said. "Just a little look." *** THEY MET in a third-floor conference room shared by Major Crimes and Homicide in the DA's office, Friel always preferring to hold his meetings here because it was cold and utilitarian, the chairs hard, the table black, the walls a cinder-block gray. It wasn't room that gave itself to witty asides or rambling non sequiturs. No one hung around in this room; they did their business and they got back at it. There were seven chairs in the room this afternoon, and every one was taken. Friel sat at the head of the table. To his right sat the deputy chief of the Suffolk County District Attorney's Homicide Unit, Maggie Mason, and to his left Sergeant Robert Burke, who ran Homicide's other squad.`,
  `Just for the hell of it?" "Maybe someone came up on him." "Doing what?" Whitey said. "Talking on his cell phone? Shit. We don't know if this has anything to do with the Marcus homicide." "Sarge," Souza said, "you want we should just blow it off? Say, fuck it, there's nothing there?" "Did I say that?" "Well— " "Did I say that?" Whitey repeated. "No." "No, I did not. Show some respect for your elders, Joseph, or we might send you back to working the crystal meth corridor around Springfield, hanging out with bikers and chicks who smell bad, eat lard straight from the can." Souza checked himself with a slow exhalation. "I just think there's something to this. That's all." "Not disagreeing, Trooper. Just saying you've got to bring us that something before we redirect manpower on what could turn out to be an isolated, unrelated incident. Also, the Last Drop's in BPD jurisdiction." "We made contact," Souza said. "They tell you it's their case?" He nodded. Whitey spread his hands. "There you go. Keep in touch with the detective in charge and keep us posted, but otherwise, leave it be for now." Friel said, "Since we're on the subject of operating theories, Sergeant, what's yours?" Whitey shrugged. "I got a couple, but that's all they are. Katherine Marcus died from the GSW to the back of her head. None of her other injuries, including the bullet wound to her left biceps, were considered lifethreatening. Bludgeoning was committed by a wooden instrument with flat edges— some kind of stick or two-by-four. ME has conclusively stated that she was not sexually assaulted. From our own legwork, we know she was planning to elope with the Harris kid. Bobby O'Donnell was her exboyfriend. Problem was he hadn't accepted the 'ex' part yet.`,
  `You dropping in on Jimmy?" They nodded. "Did you have some kind of, what, break in the case?" Sean shook his head. "Just dropping in to pay our respects, see how they're doing." "They're okay right now. I think they're worn out, you know? Far as I can tell, Jimmy hasn't gone to bed since yesterday. Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes, so I offered to pick some up, forgot I'd left my wallet in the car." He held it up in his swollen hand, then slipped it into his pocket. Whitey put his own hands in his pockets, rocked back on his heels, a tight smile on his face. Sean said, "That looks painful." "This?" Dave raised his hand again, considered it. "Ain't too bad, really." Sean nodded, added his own tight smile to Whitey's, the two of them standing there, looking in at Dave. "I was playing pool the other night?" Dave said. "You know the table they got at McGills, Sean. A good half of it is against the wall, you got to keep using that shitty short stick." Sean said, "Sure." "So the cue ball's lying just a hair off the rail, and the target ball's the other end of the table. I pull back my hand to shoot, like really hard, forgetting I'm against the wall? And bam! My hand goes through the fucking wall almost." "Ouch," Sean said. "You make it?" Whitey said. "Huh?" "The shot." Dave frowned. "Scratched. 'Course I was no good for the rest of the game." "'Course not," Whitey said. "Yeah," Dave said. "Sucked, 'cause I was in the zone until that happened." Whitey nodded, looked over at Dave's car. "Hey, you have the same problem I had with mine?" Dave looked back at his car. "Never had a problem with mine, no." "Shit.`,
  `We got to wait till his average goes down before we can dump him." "That road-rage thing," Dave said. "I saw your name once in the paper." "Dave reads," Sean said to Jimmy. "Not books on shooting pool, though," Whitey said with a smile. "How's that hand feeling?" Jimmy looked over at Dave, caught his eyes just as Dave dropped them, Jimmy getting a strong sense the big cop was fucking with Dave, pushing him. Jimmy had experienced enough of that back in the day to know its tone, and he realized it was Dave's hand the cop was razzing him about. So what had he meant about shooting pool? Dave opened his mouth to speak, but then his face was stricken by something over Sean's shoulder. Jimmy followed his gaze and every inch of him stiffened. Sean turned his head and saw Celeste Boyle holding a dark blue dress, the hanger up by her shoulder so that the dress hovered beside her as if covering a body no one could see. Celeste saw the look on Jimmy's face and said, "I'll take it over to the funeral home, Jim. Really." Jimmy looked like he'd forgotten how to move. Annabeth said, "You don't have to do that." "I want to," Celeste said with a weird, desperate laugh. "Really. I'd like to. It'll get me out for a few minutes. I'd be happy to, Anna." "You're sure?" Jimmy said, his voice coming out of him with a small croak. "Yeah, yeah," Celeste said. Sean couldn't remember the last time he'd seen a person so desperate to leave a room. He came out of his chair toward her, hand extended. "We met a few times. I'm Sean Devine." "Oh, right." Celeste's hand was slick with sweat as it slid into Sean's. "You cut my hair once," Sean said.`,
  `Your partner thinks Dave killed Katie." Shit. Sean couldn't fucking believe this. "My partner wants to take a closer look at Dave. It's not the same thing. We don't have a suspect, Celeste. Okay? We don't. What we have are holes in Dave's story. We close those holes, it's over and done. No worries." He was mugged, Celeste wanted to say. He came home with blood all over him but only because someone tried to mug him. He didn't do it. Even if I think he might have, another part of me knows that Dave is not that kind of guy. I make love to him. I married him. And I wouldn't marry a killer, you fucking cop. She tried to remember the way in which she'd planned to be calm when the police arrived asking questions. That night, as she'd washed his clothes of blood, she was sure that she'd had a plan for how to deal with this. But she hadn't known Katie was dead at that point and that the cops would be questioning her about Dave's involvement in her death. How could she have predicted that? And this cop, he was so smooth and cocky and charming. He wasn't the potbellied, hungover, grizzled type she'd expected. He was an old friend of Dave's. Dave had told her that this man, Sean Devine, had been on the street with him and Jimmy Marcus when Dave had been abducted. And he'd grown up into this tall, smart, handsome guy with a voice you could listen to all night and eyes that seemed to peel you away in layers. Jesus Christ. How was she supposed to deal with this? She needed time. She needed time to think and be by herself and look at the situation rationally. She didn't need a dead girl's dress staring back up at her from the backseat and a cop on the other side of the car staring at her with venomous, bedroom eyes.`,
  `"Sure." "Dave'll probably be leaving soon to take Michael home. I don't know what your schedule's like, but I was kind of hoping maybe you'd keep Annabeth company for a bit. Just so she's not alone, you know? Celeste will probably be back, so it won't be long. I mean, Val and his brothers took the girls out to a movie, so there's no one in the house, and I know Annabeth doesn't want to come down to the funeral home yet, so I just, I dunno, I figured…" Sean said, "I don't think it'll be a problem. I gotta check with my sarge, but our official shift was over a couple hours ago. Let me talk to him. Okay?" "I appreciate it." "Sure." Sean started walking back toward the kitchen and then he stopped, looked back at Jimmy. "Actually, Jim, I need to ask you something." "Go ahead," Jimmy said, getting that wary con's look of his. Sean came back down the hallway. "We got a couple of reports that you had a problem with that kid you mentioned this morning, that Brendan Harris." Jimmy shrugged. "Not problems, really. I just don't care for the kid." "Why?" "I don't know." Jimmy put the cordless in his front pocket. "Some people just rub you wrong. You know?" Sean stepped in close, put a hand on Jimmy's shoulder. "He was dating Katie, Jim. They were planning to elope." "Bullshit," Jimmy said, his eyes on the floor. "We found brochures for Vegas in her backpack, Jim. We made a few calls and found reservations under both their names with TWA. Brendan Harris confirmed it." Jimmy shrugged off Sean's hand. "He kill my daughter?" "No." "You're a hundred percent positive." "Close to it. He passed a poly with flying colors, man. Plus, the boy don't strike me as the type.`,
  `"Sean," Whitey said, and started ticking off points on his fingers, "the guy lied to us about when he left McGills. He lied to us about when he got home. He was parked outside the Last Drop when the victim left. He was at two of the same bars as she was, yet he's trying to cover that up. He's got a badly bruised fist and a bullshit story about how it got that way. He knew the victim, which as we've already agreed, our suspect did, too. He fits the profile— to a fucking T— of your average thrill killer; he's white, midthirties, marginally employed, and, guessing by what you told me yesterday, he was sexually abused as a kid. You kidding me? On paper, this guy should be in jail already." "You just said it yourself, though— he's a past victim of sexual abuse, and yet Katherine Marcus wasn't sexually assaulted. That don't make sense, Sarge." "Maybe he just whacked off over her." "There was no semen at the scene." "It rained." "Not where her body was found. In the random thrill kill, sexual emission is part of the equation, like, ninety-nine-point-nine percent of the time. Where is it in this case?" Whitey lowered his head and drummed the sides of the light pole with his palms. "You were friends with the victim's father and a potential suspect when you were— " "Oh, come on." "— kids. That compromises you. Don't tell me it don't. You're a fucking liability here." "I'm a— ?" Sean lowered his voice and brought his hand back down from his chest. "Look," he said, "I'm just in disagreement with you over the profile of the suspect. I'm not saying that if we zero in on Dave Boyle for more than just a few inconsistencies, I won't be right there with you to bust him.`,
  `You know I will be. But if you go to the DA right now with what you got, what's he going to do?" Whitey's palms drummed a little harder against the pole. "Really," Sean said. "What's he going to do?" Whitey raised his arms above his head and let out a shuddering yawn. He met Sean's eyes and gave him a weary frown. "Point taken. But"— he held up a finger— "but, you clubhouse fucking lawyer, you, I'm going to find the stick she was beat with, or the gun, or some bloody clothes. I don't know what exactly, but I'm going to find something. And when I find it, I'm going to drop your friend." "He ain't my friend," Sean said. "Turns out you're right? I'll have my cuffs off my hip faster than yours." Whitey came off the pole and stepped up to Sean. "Don't compromise yourself on this, Devine. You do that, you'll compromise me, and I'll bury you. I'm talking a transfer to the goddamn Berkshires, pulling radar-gun details from a fucking snowmobile." Sean ran both hands up his face and through his hair, trying to rub the weariness out of him. "Ballistics should be back by now," he said. Whitey stepped back from him. "Yeah, that's where I'm going. Lab work on the prints should be in the computer, too. I'm going to run them, hope we get lucky. You got your cell?" Sean patted his pocket. "Yeah." "I'll call you later." Whitey turned away from Sean and headed down Crescent for the cruiser, Sean feeling washed in the man's disappointment, that probationary period suddenly seeming a lot more real than it had this morning. He headed back up Buckingham toward Jimmy's as Dave walked down the front steps with Michael. "Heading home?" Dave stopped.`,
  `"You don't seem like a childish man." Sean shrugged. In his experience, everyone was childish at one time or another. It's what you reverted to, particularly when the shit piled up. In more than a year, he'd never spoken to anyone about Lauren— not his parents, his few stray friends, not even the police psychologist the commander had made a brief and pointed mention of once Lauren's moving out had become common knowledge around the barracks. But here was Annabeth, a stranger who'd suffered a loss, and he could feel her probing for his loss, needing to see it or share it or something along those lines, needing to know, Sean figured, that she wasn't being singled out. "My wife's a stage manager," he said quietly. "For road shows, you know? Lord of the Dance toured the country last year— my wife stagemanaged. That sort of thing. She's doing one now— Annie Get Your Gun, maybe. I'm not sure, to tell you the truth. Whatever they're recycling this year. We were a weird couple. I mean, our jobs, right, how further apart can you get?" "But you loved her," Annabeth said. He nodded. "Yeah. Still do." He took a breath, leaning back in his chair and sucking it down. "So the guy I gave the tickets to, he was…" Sean's mouth went dry and he shook his head, had the sudden urge to just get the hell off this porch and out of this house. "He was a rival?" Annabeth said, her voice delicate. Sean took a cigarette from the pack and lit one, nodding. "That's a nice word for it. Yeah, we'll say that. A rival. And my wife and I, we were going through some shit for a while. Neither of us was around much, and so on.`,
  `And this, uh, rival— he moved in on her." "And you reacted badly," Annabeth said. A statement, not a question. Sean rolled his eyes in her direction. "You know anyone who reacts well?" Annabeth gave him a hard look, one that seemed to suggest that sarcasm was below him, or maybe just something she wasn't fan of in general. "You still love her, though." "Sure. Hell, I think she still loves me." He stubbed out his cigarette. "She calls me all the time. Calls me and doesn't talk." "Wait, she— " "I know," he said. "— calls you up and doesn't say a word?" "Yup. Been going on for about eight months now." Annabeth laughed. "No offense, but that's the weirdest thing I've heard in a while." "No argument." He watched a fly dart in and away from the bare lightbulb. "One of these days, I figure, she's gotta talk. That's what I'm holding out for." He heard his half-assed chuckle die in the night and the echo of it embarrassed him. So they sat in silence for a bit, smoking, listening to the buzz of the fly as it made its crazy darts toward the light. "What's her name?" Annabeth asked. "This whole time, you've never once said her name." "Lauren," he said. "Her name's Lauren." Her name hung in the air for a bit like the loose strand of a cobweb. "And you loved her since you were kids?" "Freshman year of college," he said. "Yeah, I guess we were kids." He could remember a November rainstorm, the two of them kissing for the first time in a doorway, the feel of goose bumps on her flesh, both of them shaking. "Maybe that's the problem," Annabeth said. Sean looked at her. "That we're not kids anymore?" "One of you, at least," she said.`,
  `I mean, Dad, she doesn't speak. At all." "Nothing?" "Zip." "Then how do you know it's her?" "I just know." "But how?" "Jesus," Sean said. "I can hear her breathing. Okay?" "How odd," his mother said. "Do you talk though, Sean?" "Sometimes. Less and less." "Well, at least you're communicating somehow," his mother said, and placed the latest clipping down in front of him. "You tell her I thought she'd find this interesting." She sat down and smoothed a wrinkle in the tablecloth with the outer edges of both palms. "When she comes home again," she said, peering at the wrinkle as it dissolved under her hands. "When she comes home," she repeated, her voice a light wisp, like the voice of a nun, certain of the essential order in all things. *** "DAVE BOYLE," Sean said to his father an hour later as they sat at one of the tall bar tables in the Ground Round. "That time he disappeared from in front of our house." His father frowned and then concentrated on pouring the rest of a Killian's into his frosted mug. As the foam neared the top of the mug and the beer slowed to a trickle of fat drops, his father said, "What— you couldn't look it up in old newspapers?" "Well— " "Why ask me? Shit. It was on TV." "Not when his kidnapper was found," Sean said, hoping that would suffice, that his father wouldn't press him on why Sean had come to him because Sean didn't have a complete answer yet. It had something to do with needing his father to place him in the context of the event, maybe help him see himself back there in a way newspapers or old case files couldn't. And maybe it was about hoping to talk to his father about something more than just the daily news, the Red Sox's need for a lefty in the bullpen.`,
  `"Shit," his father said. "He die on the outside at least?" Sean considered lying, but he was already shaking his head. "Inside. Walpole. Cirrhosis." "When?" "Not long after you moved. Six years ago, maybe seven." His father's mouth widened around a silent "seven." He sipped his beer and the liver spots on the back of his hands seemed more pronounced in the yellow light hanging above them. "It's so easy to lose track. To lose time." "I'm sorry, Dad." His father grimaced. It was his only response to sympathy or compliments. "Why? You didn't do it. Hell, Tim did himself in when he killed Sonny Todd." "Over a pool game. Right?" His father shrugged. "They were both drunk. Who knows anymore? They were drunk and they both had big mouths and bad tempers. Tim's temper was just a lot worse than Sonny Todd's." His father sipped some more beer. "So, what's Dave Boyle's disappearance have to do with— what was her name, was it Katherine? Katherine Marcus?" "Yeah." "So what does the one have to do with the other?" "I'm not saying they do." "You're not saying they don't." Sean smiled in spite of himself. Give him a hardened gangbanger in the box any day, some guy trying to lawyer up who knew the system better than most judges, because Sean would crack him. But take one of these oldtimers, these hard-as-nails, mistrustful bastards from his father's generation — working stiffs with a lot of pride and no respect for any state or municipal office— and you could bang at them all night, and if they didn't want to tell you anything, you'd still be there in the morning with nothing but the same unanswered questions. "Hey, Dad, let's not worry about any connections just yet." "Why not?" Sean held up a hand.`,
  `"Okay? Just humor me." "Oh, sure, it's what's keeping me alive, the chance I might get to humor my own son." Sean felt his hand tighten around the handle of his glass mug. "I looked up the case file on Dave's abduction. The investigating officer is dead. No one else remembers the case, and it's still listed as unsolved." "So?" "So, I remember you coming into my room maybe a year after Dave came home and saying, 'It's over. They got the guys.'" His father shrugged. "They got one of them." "So, why didn't— ?" "In Albany," his father said. "I saw the picture in the paper. The guy had confessed to a couple molestations in New York and claimed he'd done a few more in Massachusetts and Vermont. The guy hung himself in his cell before he could get to the particulars. But I recognized the guy's face from the sketch the cop drew in our kitchen." "You're sure?" He nodded. "Hundred percent. The investigating detective— his name was, ah— " "Flynn," Sean said. His father nodded. "Mike Flynn. Right. I'd kept in contact with him, you know, a bit. So I called him after I saw the picture in the paper, and he said, yeah, it was the same guy. Dave had confirmed it." "Which one?" "Huh?" "Which guy?" "Oh. The, ah, how'd you describe him? 'The greasy one who looked sleepy.'" Sean's child's words seemed strange coming out of his father's mouth and across the table at him. "The passenger." "Yeah." "And his partner?" Sean said. His father shook his head. "Died in a car crash. Or so the other one said. That's as far as I know, but I wouldn't put too much stock in what I know. Hell, you had to tell me Tim Marcus was dead." Sean drained what remained in his mug, pointed at his father's empty glass.`,
  `"Let's say there are a couple of circumstantial things which make Dave look like someone we'd like to keep an eye on." "You call that an answer?" "You call that a question?" His father's terrific smile broke across his face then and erased a good fifteen years from his face, Sean remembering how that smile could spread through the whole house when he was young, lighting everything up. "So you were bugging me about Dave because you're wondering if what those guys did to him could turn him into a guy who'd kill a young girl." Sean shrugged. "Something like that." His father gave that some thought as he stirred the peanuts in the bowl between them and sipped some more beer. "I don't think so." Sean chuckled. "You know him that well, do you?" "No. I just remember him as a kid. He didn't have that kind of thing in him." "Lot of nice kids grow up to be adults who do shit you wouldn't believe." His father cocked an eyebrow at him. "You trying to tell me about human nature?" Sean shook his head. "Just police work." His father leaned back in his chair, considered Sean with the tug of a smile playing at the corners of his mouth. "Come on. Enlighten me." Sean felt his face redden a bit. "Hey, no, I'm just— " "Please." Sean felt foolish. It was amazing how fast his father could do that, make him feel as if what would pass as a normal set of observations with most of the people Sean knew was, in his father's eyes, the boy Sean trying to act grown up and merely succeeding at sounding pompous instead. "Give me a little credit. I think I know a bit about people and crime. It's, you know, my job." "So you think Dave could have butchered a nineteen-year-old girl, Sean?`,
  `The last one left, and yet still the youngest, always the youngest, squaring off at all times against even the whiff of condescension from anyone, particularly his son. Blocking out the whole world, if he had to, before he'd endure that, or even the perception of it. Because all those who'd had the right to behave that way toward him had long since passed from the earth. His father glanced at Sean's beer and tossed some singles onto the table for a tip. "You about done?" he said. *** THEY WALKED BACK across Route 28 and up the entrance road with its yellow speed bumps and sprinkler spray. "You know what your mother likes?" his father said. "What?" "When you write to her. You know, a card every now and then for no good reason. She says you send funny cards and she likes the way you write. She keeps them in the bedroom in a drawer. Has ones going back to when you were in college." "Okay." "Every now and then, you know? Drop one in the mail." "Sure." They reached Sean's car and his father looked up at the dark windows of his duplex. "She gone to bed?" Sean asked. His father nodded. "She's driving Mrs. Coughlin to physical therapy in the morning." His father reached out abruptly and shook Sean's hand. "Good seeing you." "You, too." "She coming back?" Sean didn't have to ask who "she" was. "I dunno. I really don't." His father looked at him under the pale yellow street lamp above them, and for a moment, Sean could see that it pierced something in him, knowing his son was hurting, knowing he'd been abandoned, damaged, and that that did something permanent to you, spooned something out of you that you'd never get back. "Well," his father said, "you look good.`,
  `Like you're taking care of yourself. You drinking too much, anything like that?" Sean shook his head. "I just work a lot." "Work's good," his father said. "Yeah," Sean said, and felt something bitter and abandoned rise up in his throat. "So…" "So." His father clapped a hand on his shoulder. "So, okay then. Don't forget to call your mother Sunday," he said, and left Sean by the car, walked toward his front door with the stride of a man twenty years younger. "Take care," Sean said, and his father raised his hand in confirmation. Sean used the remote to unlock the car, and he was reaching for the door handle when he heard his father say, "Hey." "Yeah?" He looked back and saw his father standing by the front door, his upper half dissolved in a soft darkness. "You were right not to get in that car that day. Remember that." Sean leaned against his car, his palms on the roof, and tried to make out his father's face in the dark. "We should have protected Dave, though." "You were kids," his father said. "You couldn't have known. And even if you could have, Sean…" Sean let that sink in. He drummed his hands on the roof and peered into the dark for his father's eyes. "That's what I tell myself." "Well?" He shrugged. "I still think we should have known. Somehow. Don't you think?" For a good minute, neither of them said anything, and Sean could hear crickets amid the hiss of the lawn sprinklers. "Good night, Sean," his father said through the hiss. "'Night," Sean said, and waited until his father had gone inside before he climbed into his car and headed home. 21 GOBLINS DAVE WAS SITTING in the living room when Celeste came home. He sat on the corner of the cracked leather couch with two columns of empty beer cans rising up beside the arm of the chair and a fresh one in his hand, the remote control resting on his thigh.`,
  `"They're a big problem, honey. Notorious chalice thieves." "Chalice thieves?" she said, and felt an urge to reach down and run her hand through his hair, the whole horrible day dropping away in this silly discussion. "I didn't know that." "Oh, yeah. Big problem," Dave said, and drained his beer as James Woods and the Baldwin brother and some drugged-up-looking girl raced down an empty road in a pickup truck, the vampire flying after them now. "Where you been?" "I dropped off the dress at Reed's." "Hours ago," Dave said. "And then I just felt like I needed to sit somewhere and think. You know?" "Think," Dave said. "Sure." He got up off the couch and walked into the kitchen, opened the fridge. "You want one?" She didn't, really, but she said, "Yeah, okay." Dave came back into the room and handed her the beer. She could often tell what kind of mood he was in by whether he'd opened the can for her. The can had been opened, but she wasn't sure if this was good or bad. She was having trouble gauging him. "So, what'd you think about?" He popped the tab on his own can and it was an even louder sound than the screeching tires on the TV as the pickup truck flipped over. "Oh, you know." "Not really, Celeste, no." "Things," she said, and took a sip of the beer. "The day, Katie being dead, poor Jimmy and Annabeth, those things." "Those things," Dave said. "You know what I was thinking about as I was walking back home with Michael, Celeste? I was thinking how embarrassing it must have been for him to hear his mother just drove off and didn't tell anyone where she was going or when she was coming back. I was thinking about that a lot." "I just told you, Dave." "Told me what?" He looked up at her and smiled again, but it wasn't boyish this time.`,
  `"Told me what, Celeste?" "I just felt like thinking. I'm sorry I didn't call. But it's been a tough couple of days. I'm not myself." "Nobody's themselves." "What?" "Like this movie?" he said. "They don't know who the real people are and who the vampires are. I've seen parts of this before, right, and that Baldwin brother there? He's going to fall in love with that blond girl, even though he knows she's been bitten. So she's going to turn into a vampire, but he don't care, right? Because he loves her. Yet she's a bloodsucker. She's going to suck his blood and turn him into the walking dead. I mean, that's the whole thing about vampirism, Celeste— there's something attractive about it. Even if you know it'll kill you and damn your soul for an eternity and you'll have to spend all your time biting people in the neck, and hiding out from the sun and, you know, Vatican hit squads. Maybe one day you wake up and forget what it was to be human. Maybe that happens, and then it's okay. You've been poisoned, but the poison ain't all that bad once you learn how to live with it." He propped his feet up on the coffee table, took a long drink from the can. "That's my opinion anyway." Celeste remained very still, sitting up on the arm of the couch and looking down at her husband. "Dave, what the fuck are you talking about?" "Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves." "Werewolves? You're not making any sense." "I'm not? You think I killed Katie, Celeste. That's the kinda sense we're making these days." "I don't…Where did you come up with that?" He picked at the beer tab with his fingernail. "You could barely look at me in Jimmy's kitchen before you left.`,
  `"I am. Don't mean I can't have a conversation, though." On the TV, the vampire was decapitating someone again, a priest this time. Celeste said, "Sean didn't ask me any questions. I overheard them talking when you went to get Annabeth's cigarettes. I don't know what you told them earlier, Dave, but they don't believe your story. They know you were at the Last Drop around last call." "What else?" "Someone saw our car in the parking lot around the time Katie left. And they don't believe your story about how you bruised your hand." Dave held the hand out in front of him, flexed it. "That it?" "That's all I heard." "And that made you think what?" She almost touched him again. For a moment, the threat seemed to have left his body and been replaced by defeat. She could see it in his shoulders and in his back and she wanted to reach out and touch him, but she held back. "Dave, just tell them about the mugger." "The mugger." "Yeah. So maybe you'd have to go to court. What's the big deal? It's a lot better than having a murder pinned on you." Now's the time, she thought. Say you didn't do it. Say you never saw Katie leave the Last Drop. Say it, Dave. Instead he said, "I see how your mind's working. I do. I come home with blood on me the same time Katie's murdered. I must have killed her." It popped out of Celeste: "Well?" Dave put down his beer then and started laughing. His feet came back up off the floor and he fell into the couch cushions and he laughed and laughed. He laughed like he was having a seizure of them, every gasp for breath turning into another giggling peal.`,
  `There's nothing to tie him to this." Whitey looked back at the door to the interrogation room. "I can break him." "He kicked our asses in there," Sean said. "I'm not even warmed up." Sean could see it in his face, though, the doubt, the first crumbling of the primary hunch. Whitey was stubborn and mean, too, if he thought he was right, but the man was too smart to ever flame out on a hunch that kept running into substantiation problems. "Look," Sean said, "let's let him sweat a bit in there." "He ain't sweating." "He might start, we leave him alone to think." Whitey looked back at the door like he wanted to burn it down. "Maybe." "I think it's the gun," Sean said. "We bust this open on that gun." Whitey chewed the inside of his mouth and eventually nodded. "It'd be nice to know more about the gun. You want to take that?" "Same guy still own the liquor store?" Whitey said, "I don't know. The case file was from 'eighty-two, but the owner then was a Lowell Looney." Sean smiled at the name. "Has a ring to it, don't it?" Whitey said, "Why don't you take a ride over? I'll watch fuckhead in there through the glass, see if he starts singing songs about dead girls in the park." *** LOWELL LOONEY was about eighty years old and looked like he could beat Sean in a hundred-yard dash. He wore an orange T-shirt from Porter's Gym over blue sweats with white piping and spanking-new Reeboks, and he moved around like he'd jump for the highest bottle behind the counter if you asked him to. "Right there," he said to Sean, pointing at a row of half-pint bottles behind the counter. "Went in through a bottle and stuck right in that wall there." Sean said, "Scary, huh?" The old man shrugged.`,
  `Now, he had a secret that made him tall, not small. Come close, he'd feel like saying to people now, I've got a secret. Closer, and I'll whisper it in your ear: I've killed someone. Dave locked his eyes on the fat cop behind the mirror: I've killed someone. And you can't prove it. Who's weak now? *** SEAN FOUND WHITEY in the office on the other side of the two-way mirror overlooking Interview Room C. Whitey stood there, one foot planted on the seat of a torn leather chair, looking in at Dave and sipping coffee. "You do the lineup?" "Not yet," Whitey said. Sean came up beside him. Dave was looking directly back at them, seemed almost to be locking eyes with Whitey as if he could see him. And, even weirder, Dave was smiling. It was a small smile, but it was there. Sean said, "Feeling bad, huh?" Whitey looked over at him. "I've felt better." Sean nodded. Whitey pointed his coffee cup at him. "You've got something. I can tell, prick. Give it up." Sean wanted to draw it out a little longer, drive Whitey a little nuts with the waiting, but in the end he didn't have the heart. "I got someone interesting who used to work at Looney Liquors." Whitey placed his coffee cup on the table behind him and took his foot off the chair. "Who?" "Ray Harris." "Ray…?" Sean felt his grin break wide across his face. "Brendan Harris's father, Sarge. And he's got a rap sheet." 23 LITTLE VINCE WHITEY SAT UP on the empty desk across from Sean's own with the probation report open in his hand. "Raymond Matthew Harris— born September the sixth, 1955. Grew up on Twelve Mayhew Street in the East Bucky Flats. Mother, Delores, a housewife.`,
  `Violates his parole, does a year solid inside." "Where he learns the error of his ways." "Apparently not. Picked up by a joint Major Crime Unit/FBI sting for trafficking stolen goods across state lines. You're going to love this. Guess what Raymond stole. Think 1984 now." "No hints?" "Go with your first instinct." "Cameras." Whitey shot him a look. "Fucking cameras. Go get me some coffee, you're not a cop anymore." "What then?" "Trivial Pursuit," Whitey said. "Never saw that one coming, did you?" "Comic books and Trivial Pursuit. Our boy's got style." "He's got a shitload of grief, too. He stole the truck in Rhode Island, drove it into Massachusetts." "Hence the federal interstate rap." "Hence," Whitey said, shooting Sean another look. "They've got his balls, basically, but he does no time." Sean sat up a bit, took his feet off his desk. "He rolled on someone?" "Looks that way," Whitey said. "After that, nothing else on the rap sheet. Raymond's probie notes that Raymond is dutiful in appearing for his appointments until he's released from probation in late eighty-six. His employment records?" Whitey looked over the file at Sean. Sean said, "Oh, I can talk now?" He opened his own file. "Employment records, IRS records, social security payments— everything comes to a dead halt in August of 1987. Poof, he disappears." "You check nationally?" "The request is being processed as we speak, good sir." "What are our possibilities?" Sean propped the soles of his shoes up on his desk again and leaned back in his chair. "One, he's dead. Two, he's in Witness Protection. Three, he went deep, deep, deep underground and just popped back into the neighborhood to pick up his gun and shoot his son's nineteen-year-old girlfriend." Whitey tossed his file down onto the empty desk.`,
  `"We don't even know if it's his gun. We don't know shit. What are we doing here, Devine?" "We're getting up for the dance, Sarge. Come on. Don't gas out on me this early. We got a guy who was a prime suspect in a robbery eighteen years ago during which the murder weapon was used. Guy's son dated the victim. Guy has a rap sheet. I want to look at him and I want to look at the son. You know, the one with no alibi." "Who passed a poly and who you and I agreed didn't have the stuff necessary to do this." "Maybe we were wrong." Whitey rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands. "Man, I'm sick of being wrong." "So you're saying you were wrong about Boyle?" Whitey's hands remained over his eyes as he shook his head. "Ain't saying that at all. I still think the guy's a piece of shit, but whether I can tie him to Katherine Marcus's death is another matter." He lowered his hands, the puffy flesh under his eyes ringed red now. "But this Raymond Harris angle doesn't look too promising, either. Okay, we take another run at the son. Fine. And we try to track down the father. But then what?" "We tie somebody to that gun," Sean said. "Gun could be in the fucking ocean by now. I know that's what I'd do with it." Sean tipped his head toward him. "You would've done that after you held up a liquor store eighteen years ago, though, too." "True." "Our guy didn't. Which means…" "He ain't as bright as me," Whitey said. "Or me." "Jury's still out there." Sean stretched in his chair, locking his fingers and raising his arms above his head, pushing toward the ceiling until he could feel the muscles stretch.`,
  `They stopped at a Dunkin' Donuts and tossed their lids in the trash on the way out the door, sipped their coffee leaning against the spoiler attached to the trunk of the sports car. Val said, "We went out last night, asked around like you said." Jimmy tapped his fist into Val's. "Thanks, man." Val tapped back. "It ain't just 'cause you did two years for me, Jim. Ain't just 'cause I miss your brain running things, either. Katie was my niece, man." "I know." "Maybe not by birth or nothing, but I loved her." Jimmy nodded. "You guys were the best uncles any kid could have had." "No shit?" "No shit." Val sipped some coffee and went silent for a bit. "Well, all right, here's the deal: looks like the cops were right about O'Donnell and Farrow. O'Donnell was in county lockup. Farrow was at a party and we personally talked to, like, nine guys who vouched for him." "All solid?" "Half, at least," Val said. "We also sniffed around and there's been no contracts floating along the street for a while. And, Jim, it's been a year and a half since the last time I can even remember a hired hit, so we'd a heard. You know?" Jimmy nodded and drank some coffee. "Now the cops have been all over this," Val said. "They're smothering the bars, the street trade around the Last Drop, everything. Every hooker I've talked to has already been questioned. Every bartender. Every single soul who was in McGills or the Last Drop that night. I mean, the law descended, Jim. So it's out there. Everyone's trying to remember something." "You talk to anybody who did?" Val held up two fingers as he took another drink. "One guy— you know Tommy Moldanado?" Jimmy shook his head.`,
  `"That's possible. But what brought her back to the Last Drop?" "I don't know." They walked to the trash barrel and dumped their cups, and Jimmy said, "What about Just Ray's kid, you find anything out there?" "Asked around in general about him. The kid's a mouse by all accounts. No trouble to anyone. If he wasn't so good-looking, I'm not sure anyone would even remember meeting him. Eve and Diane both said he loved her, Jim. Loved her like once-in-a-lifetime kinda love. I'll take a run at him, you want." "Let's hold off for the time being," Jimmy said. "Watch and wait when it comes to him. Try to track down that Vincent kid." "Yeah, okay." Jimmy opened the passenger door, saw Val looking at him over the roof, Val holding something back, chewing it. "What?" Val blinked in the sunlight, smiled. "Huh?" "You want to spit something. What is it?" Val lowered his chin out of the sun, spread his arms on the roof. "I heard something this morning. Just before we left." "Yeah?" "Yeah," Val said, and looked off into the doughnut shop for a moment. "I heard those two cops were by Dave Boyle's again. You know, Sean from the Point and his partner, the fat one?" Jimmy said, "Dave was in McGills that night, yeah. They probably just forgot to ask him something, had to come back." Val's gaze left the doughnut shop and his eyes met Jimmy's. "They took him with them when they left, Jim. You know what I mean? Put him in the backseat." *** MARSHALL BURDEN CAME into the Homicide Unit during lunch hour and called to Whitey as he pushed through the small gate attached to the reception desk. "You the guys looking for me?" Whitey said, "That's us. Come on over." Marshall Burden was a year short of his thirty and he looked it.`,
  `It was amazing how friendly three beers could be after a long, hard day. They were taking Dave by the hand as he walked up the hill toward Buckingham Avenue. They were saying, Hey, ain't it great to be us? Ain't it just the flatout balls to be turning a new leaf, shedding yourself of soiled secrets, ready to renew your vows to your loved ones and become the man you always knew you could be? Why, it's just terrific. And look who we have ahead of us, idling at the corner in his shiny sports car. He's smiling at us. That's Val Savage, smiling away, waving us over! Come on. Let's go say hi. "Dandy Dave Boyle," Val said as Dave approached the car. "How they hanging, brother?" "Always to the left," Dave said, and squatted down by the car. He rested his elbows on the slot where the window had descended into the door and peered in at Val. "What're you up to?" Val shrugged. "Not much, man. Was looking for someone to grab a beer with, maybe a bite to eat." Dave couldn't believe this. Here he'd been thinking the same thing. "Yeah?" "Yeah. You could go for a few pops, maybe a game of pool, right, Dave?" "Sure." Dave was a bit surprised, actually. He got along with Jimmy and Val's brother Kevin, even sometimes with Chuck, but he never remembered Val showing anything but complete apathy in his presence. It must be Katie, he figured. In death, she was bringing them all together. They were united in their loss, forging bonds through the sharing of tragedy. "Hop in," Val said. "We'll hit a place I know across town. Good bar. A buddy of mine owns it." "Across town?" Dave looked back up the empty street he'd just come down.`,
  `I'll hang with you for a bit, see how it plays out." "You bathe today?" "First thing." "All right then." He looked over at Sean. "What about you?" Sean said, "I got a guy in holding I want to talk to. This is yours now. I'll take Souza back with me." Whitey nodded and walked with him toward their car. "We tie Boyle to this, might turn him on the Marcus murder. Get ourselves a twofer." Sean said, "A double homicide ten blocks apart?" "Maybe she walked out of the bar and saw it." Sean shook his head. "Timeline's all fucked-up. If Boyle killed that guy, he did it between one-thirty and one-fifty-five. Then he'd have to drive ten blocks, find Katie Marcus just driving down the street at one-forty-five. I don't buy it." Whitey leaned against the side of their car. "Yeah, I don't either." "Plus, the hole coming out of that guy's back? It was small. Too small for a thirty-eight, you ask me. Different guns, different doers." Whitey nodded, looking down at his shoes. "You're going to take another run at the Harris kid?" "Keeps coming back around to his father's gun." "Maybe get a picture of the father? Have someone do an age-progression, float that around. See if someone's seen him." Souza came around and opened the passenger door. "I'm with you, Sean?" Sean nodded, turned back to Whitey. "It's a little thing." "What's that?" "Whatever we're missing. It's a minor detail. I figure it out, I'll close this." Whitey smiled. "What's the last open homicide you got on your plate, kid?" The name popped off Sean's tongue. "Eileen Fields, eight months cold." "They can't all be dunkers," Whitey said, and started walking back toward the Cadillac. "Know what I mean?" *** BRENDAN'S TIME in the holding cell hadn't been kind to him.`,
  `Like the way they say a good quarterback sees the whole field? Jimmy saw the whole field on a job. He saw everything that could possibly go wrong. Guy was a fucking genius." "But he went straight." "Sure," Val said, lighting a cigarette. "For Katie. And then for Annabeth. I don't think his heart's ever been in it, between you and me, but there you go. Sometimes, people grow up. My first wife said that was my problem— I couldn't grow up. I like the night too much. Day's just something you sleep through." "I always thought it would be different," Dave said. "What's that?" "Being grown-up. You'd feel different, right? You'd feel grown-up. A man." "You don't feel that way?" Dave smiled. "Sometimes maybe. In glimpses. But most of the time I don't feel much different than I did when I was eighteen. I wake up a lot going, 'I got a kid? I got a wife?' How'd that happen?" Dave could feel his tongue thickening with the booze, his head getting that floating feel because he never had gotten that bite to eat. He felt a need to explain. To make Val see the guy he was and to like that guy. "I think I always figured one day it would be permanent. You know? One day you'd just wake up and feel grown-up. Feel like you had a handle on things the way fathers always did in those old TV shows." "Ward Cleaver, like?" Val said. "Yeah. Or even like those sheriffs, you know, James Arness, guys like that. They were men. Permanently." Val nodded and sipped some beer. "Guy in prison says to me once, he says, 'Happiness comes in moments, and then it's gone until the next time. Could be years. But sadness'"— Val winked— "'sadness settles in.'" He stubbed out his cigarette.`,
  `Jimmy, wearing a black leather jacket over a dark turtleneck and khakis, nodding at Dave as he stepped up to Val at the bar. He said something in Val's ear and Val looked back over his shoulder at Dave and then said something to Jimmy. Dave started to feel woozy. It was all the booze on an empty stomach, he was sure. But it was also something about Jimmy, something about the way he'd nodded to him, his face blank and yet somehow determined. And why the hell did he look bulked up, as if he'd gained ten pounds since yesterday? And what was he doing over here in Chelsea, the night before his daughter's wake? Jimmy came over and slid into Val's seat, across from Dave. He said, "How's it going?" "Little drunk," Dave admitted. "You gain some weight?" Jimmy gave him a quizzical smile. "No." "You look bigger." Jimmy shrugged. "What're you doing around here?" Dave asked. "I come here a lot. Me and Val have known Huey for years. I mean, going way back. Why don't you drink that shot, Dave?" Dave picked up the shot glass. "I'm feeling a bit hammered already." "Who's it hurt?" Jimmy said, and Dave realized Jimmy held a shot of his own. He raised it and met Dave's glass. "To our children," Jimmy said. "To our children," Dave managed, really feeling out of sorts now, as if he'd slid out of the day, through the night, and into a dream, a dream in which all the faces were too close, but their voices sounded like they were coming from the bottom of a sewer. Dave downed the shot, grimacing against the burn, and Val slid into the booth beside him. Val put his arm around him and took a drink of beer directly from the pitcher.`,
  `She picked up the receiver and dialed Jimmy's home. She did so with tremors in her wrists, thinking, Please, someone, answer. Just answer. Please. *** THE SMILE on Jimmy's face was sliding now, back and forth, up one side, back down, and then up the other, and Dave tried to focus on the bar, but that was sliding, too, as if the bar were on a boat and the sea was getting pissed. "'Member we took Ray Harris here that one time?" Val said. "Sure," Jimmy said. "Good old Ray." "Now Ray," Val said, and slapped the table in front of Dave, "was one hilarious son of a bitch." "Yeah," Jimmy said softly, "Ray was funny. He could make you laugh." "Most people called him Just Ray," Val said as Dave tried to concentrate on just who the fuck they were talking about. "But I called him Ray Jingles." Jimmy snapped his fingers, pointed at Val. "That's right. 'Cause of all the change." Val leaned into Dave, spoke into his ear. "This guy, right? He carried like ten bucks in change in his pocket on any given day. No one knew why. He just liked having a lot of change in his pocket, case he had to make a phone call to Libya or some fucking place, I guess. Who knows? But he'd walk around with his hands in his pockets and just jingle that change all day long. I mean, the guy was a thief, and it was like, 'Who wouldn't hear you coming, Ray?' But apparently, he left the change at home during jobs." Val sighed. "Funny guy." Val took his arm off Dave's shoulder and lit another cigarette. The smoke climbed up into Dave's face, and he felt it crawl all over his cheeks and burrow through his hair.`,
  `Ray was the kinda guy, he could talk about anything. He had an interest in everything. That's rare. Then my wife died. You know? She died and they sent some guard into my cell to say, 'Sorry, convict, your wife passed last night at eight-fifteen. She's gone.' And the thing was? What killed me about my wife dying, Dave? It was that she had to go through it completely alone. I know what you're thinking, we all die alone. True. That last stage when you've slipped away, yeah, you're alone. But my wife had skin cancer. She spent the last six months dying slow. And I could have been there for that. I could have helped her with the dying. Not the death, but the dying. I wasn't there, though. Ray, a guy I liked, robbed me and my wife of that." Dave could see an ink-blue slice of river— lit by the bridge lights and shining— reflected in Jimmy's pupils. He said, "Why you telling me this, Jimmy?" Jimmy pointed over Dave's left shoulder. "I made Ray kneel down right over there and I shot him twice. Once in the chest, once in the throat." Val came off the wall by the door and walked over to Dave's left, taking his time, the weeds rising up behind him. Dave's throat closed up and his insides went dry. Dave said, "Hey, Jimmy, I don't know what— " Jimmy said, "Ray begged. He said we were friends. He said he had a son. He said he had a wife. He said his wife was pregnant. He said he'd move away. He said he'd never bother me again. He begged me to let him live so he could see his child being born. He said he knew me and he knew I was a good man and he knew I didn't want to do this." Jimmy looked up at the bridge.`,
  `"Youth," Dave said. Jimmy hung his head. "I don't remember having one," Dave said. "And she was the dream of it, and I just snapped, I guess." It killed him to say this to Jimmy, to tear him with this, but Dave just wanted to get home and get his head right and see his family, and if this was what it took, he was going to do it. He was going to make things right. And a year from now, when the real killer had been caught and convicted, Jimmy would understand his sacrifice. "Some part of me," he said, "never got out of that car, Jim. Just like you said. Some other Dave came back to the neighborhood in Dave's clothing, but he wasn't Dave. Dave's still in the basement. You know?" Jimmy nodded, and when he raised his head, Dave could see that his eyes were damp and shiny and filled with compassion, maybe even love. "It was the dream, then?" Jimmy whispered. "It was the dream, yeah," Dave said, and felt the cold of his lie spread through his stomach and grow so cold that he thought it might have been hunger, having emptied his insides just minutes before into the Mystic Rive. It was a different cold, though, different than any he'd ever felt before. A freezing cold. So cold, it was almost hot. No, it was hot. It was on fire now and licking its way down through his groin and up through his chest, sucking the air out of him. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Val Savage jump in the air and shout, "Yes! That's what I'm talking about!" He looked in Jimmy's face. Jimmy, his lips moving too slowly and too quickly at the same time, said, "We bury our sins here, Dave.`,
  `I'd like to get me one of those. So you going to use it?" "Now?" "Yeah. You going to draw on me?" Sean smiled. "No, Johnny." Johnny said, "The fuck you smiling for? Draw on me. We'll see what happens. It'll be cool." He thrust the gun out, his arm straight, the muzzle maybe an inch from Sean's chest now. Sean said, "I'd say you got the drop on me, partner. Know what I mean?" "Got the drop, Ray," Johnny called. "On a fucking cop, dude. Me! Check it out." Sean said, "Let's not let this get out— " "Saw this movie once, right? Cop's chasing this black guy on a roof? Nigger threw his ass off. Cop's like all 'Aaagh' and shit the whole way down. Nigger's so bad-ass he don't care the cop got the wife and little shits at home. Nigger's that cool, man." Sean had seen this before. Back when he was in uniform and sent as crowd control on a bank robbery gone bad, the guy inside gradually growing stronger for a two-hour period, feeling the power of the gun in his hand and the effect it had, Sean watching him rant and rave over the monitor hooked up to the bank cameras. At the start, the guy had been terrified, but he'd gotten over that. Fell in love with that gun. And for one moment, Sean saw Lauren looking over at him from the pillow, one hand pressed to the side of her head. He saw his dream daughter, smelled her, and thought what a shitty thing it would be to die without meeting her or seeing Lauren again. He focused on the empty face before him. He said, "You see that guy to your left, Johnny? The one in the doorway?" Johnny's eyes darted fast to his left.`,
  `"Yeah." "He doesn't want to shoot you. He doesn't." "Don't care if he does," Johnny said, but Sean could see it got to the kid, his eyes getting rabbity now, jerking up and down. "But if you shoot me, he has no choice." "Ain't afraid of dying." "I know that. Thing is, though? He won't shoot you in the head or nothing. We don't kill kids, man. But if he shoots you from where he's standing, you know where that bullet's going to go?" Sean kept his eyes on Johnny, even though his head seemed to be magnetized to the gun in the kid's hand, wanting to look down on it, see where the trigger was, if the kid was pulling on it at all, Sean thinking, I don't want to get shot, and I definitely don't want to get shot by a kid. He couldn't think of a more pathetic way to go. He could feel Brendan, ten feet to his left and frozen, probably thinking the same thing. Johnny licked his lips. "It's going to go through your armpit and into your spine, man. It's going to paralyze you. You'll be like those kids on those Jimmy Fund commercials. You know the ones. Sitting in the wheelchair, all frozen up on one side, head hanging off the chair. You'll be a drooler, Johnny. People will have to hold the cup up beside your head so you can suck from the straw." Johnny made up his mind. Sean could see it, as if a light had clicked off in the kid's dark brain, and Sean felt the fear seize him now, knew this kid was going to pull the trigger if only to hear the sound. "My fucking nose, man," Johnny said, and turned toward Brendan. Sean heard his own breath pop out of his mouth in surprise, and he looked down to see that gun sweeping away from his body, as if revolving on top of a tripod.`,
  `When she pulled away, Jimmy could still feel her cheek on his chest like a permanent mark. She climbed off him and sat on the floor in front of him and looked into his face. She tilted her head toward the baby monitor and, for a moment, they listened to their daughters sleep. "You know what I told them when I put them to bed tonight?" Jimmy shook his head. Annabeth said, "I told them they had to be extra-special nice to you for a while because as much as we loved Katie? You loved her even more. You loved her so much because you'd created her and held her when she was tiny and sometimes your love for her was so big that your heart filled like a balloon and felt like it was going to pop from loving her." "Jesus," Jimmy said. "I told them that their Daddy loved them that much, too. That he had four hearts and they were all balloons and they were all filled up and aching. And your love meant we'd never have to worry. And Nadine said, 'Never?'" "Please." Jimmy felt like he was crushed under blocks of granite. "Stop." She shook her head once, holding him in her calm eyes. "I told Nadine, 'That's right. Never. Because Daddy is a king, not a prince. And kings know what must be done— even if it's hard— to make things right. Daddy is a king, and he will do— " "Anna— " "— he will do whatever he has to do for those he loves. Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone. Great men try to make things right. And that's all that matters. That's what great love is. That's why Daddy is a great man." Jimmy felt blinded. He said, "No." "Celeste called," Annabeth said, her words like darts now.`,
  `"Don't— " "She wanted to know where you were. She told me how she'd mentioned her own suspicions about Dave to you." Jimmy wiped his eyes with the back of his hand, watched his wife as if he'd never seen her before. "She told me that, Jimmy, and I thought what kind of wife says those things about her husband? How fucking gutless do you have to be to tell those kinds of tales out of school? And why would she tell you? Huh, Jim? Why would she run to you?" Jimmy had an idea— he'd always had an idea about Celeste and the way she looked at him sometimes— but he didn't say anything. Annabeth smiled, as if she could see the answer in his face. "I could have called you on your cell. I could have. Once she told me what you knew, and I remembered seeing you leave with Val, I could guess what you were doing, Jimmy. I'm not stupid." She was never that. "But I didn't call you. I didn't stop it." Jimmy's voice cracked around the words: "Why not?" Annabeth cocked her head at him as if the answer should have been obvious. She stood, looking down at him with that curious glare, and she kicked off her shoes. She unzipped her jeans and pulled them down her thighs, bent at the waist and pushed them to her ankles. She stepped out of them as she removed her shirt and bra. She pulled Jimmy out of his chair. She pressed him to her body, and she kissed his damp cheekbones. "They," she said, "are weak." "Who's they?" "Everyone," she said. "Everyone but us." She pushed Jimmy's shirt off his shoulders and Jimmy could see her face down at the Pen Channel the first night they'd ever gone out.`,
  `You came back here because you'd built this village, you knew its dangers and its pleasures, and most important, nothing that happened here surprised you. There was a logic to the corruption and the bloodbaths and the bar fights and the stickball games and the Saturday-morning lovemaking. No one else saw the logic, and that was the point. No one else was welcome here. Lauren leaned back into him, her head beneath his chin, and Sean could feel her doubt, but also her resolve, her need to rebuild her faith in him. She said, "How scared were you when that kid pointed the gun in your face?" "The truth?" "Please." "Close to losing bladder control." She craned her head out from underneath his chin and looked at him. "Seriously." "Yeah," he said. "Did you think of me?" "I did," he said. "I thought of both of you." "What'd you think?" "I thought of this," he said. "I thought of now." "The parade, everything?" He nodded. She kissed his neck. "You're full of shit, honey, but it's sweet of you to say." "I'm not lying," he said. "I'm not." She looked down at Nora. "She's got your eyes." "And your nose." She was staring at their baby when she said, "I hope this works." "Me, too." He kissed her. They leaned back against the wall together, a steady stream of people passing by along the sidewalk in front of them, and then Celeste suddenly stood before them. Her skin was pale and her hair was speckled with dandruff and she kept pulling on her fingers as if trying to pop them from the sockets. She blinked at Sean. She said, "Hey, Trooper Devine." Sean held out his hand because she looked like she needed contact or she'd float away. "Hi, Celeste.`,
