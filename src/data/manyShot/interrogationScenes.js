  `"Look, Mr. Boyle," Whitey said, "we know you left McGills before you said you did. We know you showed up a half-hour later in the parking lot of the Last Drop around the same time the Marcus girl left. And we sure as shit know you didn't get that swollen hand by banging it off a wall making a pool shot." Dave groaned. He said, "How about a Sprite, something like that?" "In a minute," Whitey said for the fourth time in the half an hour they'd been in here. "Tell us what really happened that night, Mr. Boyle." "I already did." "You lied." Dave shrugged. "Your opinion." "No," Whitey said. "Fact. You lied about leaving McGills. The fucking clock was stopped, Mr. Boyle, five minutes before you claim to have left." "Five whole minutes?" "You think this is funny?" Dave leaned back a bit in the chair and Sean waited to hear the telltale crack it emitted before it would buckle, but it didn't, Dave pushing it to the edge, but not going any further. "No, Sergeant, I don't think it's funny. I'm tired. I'm hungover. And my car was not only stolen but now you're telling me you won't release it to me. You say I left McGills five minutes before I said I did?" "At least." "Fine. I'll give you that. Maybe I did. I don't look at my watch as much as you guys apparently do. So if you say I left McGills at ten of one instead of five of one, I say, okay. Maybe I did. Oops. But that's it. I went home right after that. I didn't go to any other bar." "You were seen in the parking lot of— " "No," Dave said. "A Honda with a dented quarter panel was seen.`,
  `Right? You know how many Hondas there are in this city? Come on, man." "How many with dents, though, Mr. Boyle, in the same place as yours?" Dave shrugged. "A bunch, I bet." Whitey looked at Sean and Sean could feel that they were losing. Dave was right— they could probably find twenty Hondas with dented quarter panels on the passenger side. Twenty, easy. And if Dave could throw that at them, then his lawyer would come up with a lot more. Whitey came around the back of Dave's chair and said, "Tell us how the blood got in your car." "What blood?" "The blood we found in your front seat. Let's start there." Dave said, "How about that Sprite, Sean?" Sean said, "Sure." Dave smiled. "I get it. You're a good cop. How about a meatball sub while you're at it?" Sean, half out of his chair, sat back down. "Ain't your bitch, Dave. Looks like you'll have to wait awhile." "You're somebody's bitch, though. Aren't you, Sean?" There was a crazy leer in his eyes when he said it, a preening cockiness, and Sean started thinking maybe Whitey was right. Sean wondered if his father, seeing this Dave Boyle, would have the same opinion of him as he'd had last night. Sean said, "The blood on your front seat, Dave. Answer the sergeant." Dave looked back up at Whitey. "We got a chain-link fence in our backyard. You know the kind, with the links curling inward at the top? I was doing yard work the other day. My landlord's old. I do it, he keeps the rent reasonable. So I'm cutting away these bamboo-looking things he's got back there— " Whitey sighed, but Dave didn't seem to notice. "— and I slip. I got this electric hedge trimmer in my hand, and I don't want to drop it, so when I slip, I fall into the chain-link fence and I slice myself against it." He patted his rib cage.`,
  `"Right here. It wasn't bad, but it bled like hell. Like ten minutes later? I gotta go pick up my son at Little League practice. It was probably still bleeding, I got into the seat. That's the best I can figure it." Whitey said, "So that was your blood in the front seat?" "Like I said— best I can figure it." "And what blood type are you?" "B negative." Whitey gave him a broad grin as he came back around the chair, perched on the edge of the table. "Funny. That's the exact type we found in the front seat." Dave held up his hands. "Well, there you go." Whitey mimicked Dave's hands. "Not quite. Care to explain the blood in the trunk? That blood wasn't B negative." "I don't know anything about any blood in my trunk." Whitey chuckled. "No idea how a good half pint of blood got in the trunk of your car?" "No, I don't," Dave said. Whitey leaned in, patted Dave's shoulder. "I don't mind telling you, Mr. Boyle, that this is not the avenue you want to take. You claim in court that you don't know how someone else's blood got in your car, how's that going to look?" "Fine, I suppose." "How do you figure?" Dave leaned back again and Whitey's hand fell from his shoulder. "You filled out the report, Sergeant." "What report?" Whitey said. Sean saw it coming and thought, Oh, shit, he's got us. "The stolen car report," Dave said. "So?" "So," Dave said, "the car wasn't in my possession last night. I don't know what the car thieves used it for, but maybe you want to find out, because it sounds like they were up to no good." For a long thirty seconds, Whitey sat completely still, and Sean could feel it dawning on him— he'd gotten too smart and he'd fucked himself.`,
  `"You know why, kid." "No," Brendan said. "I don't." Sean leaned across the desk, barely resisting an inexplicable desire to keep going, to lunge at Brendan Harris and squeeze his throat in his hand. "The gun that killed your girlfriend, Brendan, was the same gun your father used in a robbery eighteen years ago. You want to tell me about that?" "My father didn't have a gun," he said, but Sean could see something beginning to go to work in the kid's brain. "No? Bullshit." He slapped the desk hard enough to jerk the kid in his chair. "You say you loved Katie Marcus? Let me tell you what I love, Brendan. I love my clearance rate. I love my ability to put down cases in seventy-two hours. Now you are fucking lying to me." "No, I'm not." "Yes, you are, kid. You know your father was a thief?" "He was a subway— " "He was a fucking thief. He worked with Jimmy Marcus. Who was also a fucking thief. And now Jimmy's daughter is killed with your father's gun?" "My father didn't have a gun." "Fuck you!" Sean bellowed, and Connolly shot up in his chair, looked over at them. "You want to bullshit someone, kid? Bullshit your cell." Sean took his keys from his belt and tossed them over his head at Connolly. "Lock this maggot up." Brendan stood. "I didn't do anything." Sean watched Connolly step up behind the kid, tensing on the balls of his feet. "You got no alibi, Brendan, and you had a prior relationship with the victim, and she was shot with your father's gun. Until I got better, I'll take you. Have a rest, think about the statements you just made to me." "You can't lock me up." Brendan looked behind him at Connolly.`,
  `Correct?" "I did and I didn't," Jimmy said. "I was mostly in back. Katie worked the registers up front." "But do you remember anything out of the ordinary? Was she acting odd? Tense? Fearful? Did she have a confrontation with a customer maybe?" "Not while I was there. I'll give you the number of the guy who worked with her in the morning. Maybe something happened before I got in that he remembers." "Appreciate that, sir. But while you were there?" "She was herself. She was happy. Maybe a little…" "What?" "No, nothing." "Sir, the littlest thing is something right now." Annabeth leaned forward. "Jimmy?" Jimmy gave them all an embarrassed grimace. "It's nothing. It was…I look up from my desk at one point and she's standing in the doorway. Just standing there, sipping a Coke through a straw, and looking at me." "Looking at you." "Yeah. And for a second, she looked like she did this one time when she was five and I was going to leave her in the car for just a sec while I ran into the drugstore. That time, right, she burst out crying because I'd just gotten back from prison and her mother had just died and I think, back then, she thought that every time you left her, even for a second, you weren't going to come back. So she'd get this look, right? I mean, whether she ended up crying or not, she'd get this look on her face like she was preparing herself to never see you again." Jimmy cleared his throat and let out a long sigh that widened his eyes. "Anyway, I hadn't seen that look in a few years, maybe seven or eight, but for a few seconds on Saturday, that's how she was looking at me." "Like she was preparing herself to never see you again." "Yeah." Jimmy watched Whitey write that in his report pad.`,
  `"A father knows. Okay?" Sean decided to let it ride for now. He tossed it back to Whitey with a nod. Whitey said, "Well, what about that? Who was she seeing?" "No one at the moment," Annabeth said. "Far as we knew." "How about ex-boyfriends? Anyone who might be holding a grudge? Guy she dumped or something?" Annabeth and Jimmy looked at each other and Sean could feel it between them— a suspect. "Bobby O'Donnell," Annabeth said eventually. Whitey placed his pen on his report pad, stared across the table at them. "We talking about the same Bobby O'Donnell?" Jimmy said, "I dunno. Coke dealer and pimp? About twenty-seven?" "That's the guy," Whitey said. "We got him pegged for a lot of shit went down in your neighborhood the past two years." "And yet you haven't charged him with anything." "Well, first off, Mr. Marcus, I'm State Police. If this crime hadn't happened in Pen Park, I wouldn't even be here. East Bucky is, for the most part, under City jurisdiction, and I can't speak for the City cops." Annabeth said, "I'll tell that to my friend Connie. Bobby and his friends blew up her flower shop." "Why?" Sean asked. "Because she wouldn't pay him," Annabeth said. "Pay him to do what?" "Not blow up her fucking flower shop," Annabeth said, and took another sip of coffee, Sean thinking it again— this woman was hard-core. Fuck with her at your peril. "So your daughter," Whitey said, "was dating him." Annabeth nodded. "Not for long. A few months, yeah, Jim? It ended back in November." "How'd Bobby take it?" Whitey asked. The Marcuses exchanged glances again, and then Jimmy said, "There was a beef one night. He came to the house with his guard dog, Roman Fallow." "And?" "And we made it clear they should leave." "Who's we?" Annabeth said, "Several of my brothers live in the apartment above us and the apartment below.`,
  `Diane, she had a knapsack in the back of her car. It had brochures for Vegas in it. She was, what, carrying them around for someone else?" "Maybe. I dunno." Eve's father had piped in then: "Honey, you know something could help, you start talking. This is Katie getting, Jesus, murdered here." Which had just brought on a fresh bucket of sobs, both girls going to hell then, beginning to wail and hug each other and shake, mouths wide and oval and slightly skewered in the pantomime of grief Sean had seen time and time again, the moment when, as Martin Friel called it, the levee broke and the permanence of the victim's absence truly hit home. Times like that, there was nothing you could do but watch or leave. They watched and waited. Eve Pigeon did look a bit like a bird, Sean thought. Her face was very sharp, her nose very thin. It nearly worked for her, though. She had a grace about her that gave her thinness an air of the almost-aristocratic. Sean guessed she was the kind of woman who looked better in formal clothing than casual, and she emanated a decency and intelligence that Sean figured would attract only serious men, weed out the scammers and Romeos. Diane, on the other hand, oozed a defeated sensuality. Sean spotted a faded bruise just behind her right eye, and she struck him as denser than Eve, more given to emotion and possibly laughter, too. A fading hope hung in both her eyes like matching flaws, a neediness that Sean knew rarely attracted any other kind of man but the predatory kind. Sean figured she'd be at the center of a few 911 domestic disturbance calls over the coming years, and that by the time the cops reached her door, that dying hope would be long gone from her eyes.`,
  `"Eve," Whitey said gently when they'd finally stopped crying, "I need to know about Roman Fallow." Eve nodded as if she'd been expecting the question, but she didn't say anything right away. She chewed the skin around her thumbnail and stared at some crumbs on the tabletop. "That jerkoff hangs around Bobby O'Donnell?" her father said. Whitey held up a hand to him, glanced over at Sean. "Eve," Sean said, knowing Eve was the one they had to get to. She'd be harder to crack than Diane, but she'd yield more in the way of pertinent detail. She looked at him. "There won't be any reprisals, if that's what's worrying you. You tell us something about Roman Fallow or Bobby, and it stays with us. They'll never know it came from you." Diane said, "What about when it goes to court? Huh? What about then?" Whitey gave Sean a look that said: You're on your own. Sean concentrated on Eve. "Unless you saw Roman or Bobby pull Katie from her car— " "No." "Then the DA wouldn't force either of you to testify in open court, Eve, no. He'd ask a lot probably, but he wouldn't force you." Eve said, "You don't know them." "Bobby and Roman? Sure I do. I put Bobby away for nine months when I was working narcotics cases." Sean reached out and laid his hand on the table about an inch from hers. "And he threatened me. But that's all he and Roman are— talk." Eve gave Sean's hand a bitter half-smile with pursed lips. "Bull…shit," she said, dragging it out. Her father said, "You don't talk like that in this house." "Mr. Pigeon," Whitey said. "No," Drew said. "My house, my rules. I won't have my daughter talking like she— " "It was Bobby," Eve said, and Diane let out a small gasp, stared at her friend as if she'd lost her mind.`,
  `Sean saw Whitey's eyebrows arch. "What was Bobby?" Sean said. "Who Katie was dating. Bobby, not Roman." "Jimmy know about this?" Drew asked his daughter. Eve let go one of those sullen shrugs Sean had found endemic to kids her age, a slow twitch of the body that said it barely cared enough to make the effort. "Eve," Drew said. "Did he?" "He knew and he didn't," Eve said. She sighed and leaned her head back, stared up at the ceiling with those dark eyes. "Her parents thought it was over because for a while she thought it was over. The only one who didn't think it was over was Bobby. He wouldn't accept it. He kept coming back. One night he held her off a third-floor landing." "You saw this?" Whitey said. She shook her head. "Katie told me. He ran into her at a party six weeks, a month ago. He convinced her to come out in the hall to talk to him. 'Cept it was a third-floor apartment, you know?" Eve wiped her face with the back of her hand, even though by the looks of her, she was all cried out at the moment. "Katie told me she kept trying to explain to him that they were broken up, but Bobby wouldn't hear it, and finally he got so mad he grabbed her by the shoulders and lifted her over the railing. He held her over the stairway. Three stories down, the psycho. And he said if she broke up with him he'd break her up. She was his girl until he said otherwise and if she didn't like it, he'd drop her right fucking then." "Jesus," Drew Pigeon said after a few moments' silence. "You know these people?" Whitey said, "So, Eve, what did Roman say to her in the bar Saturday night?" Eve didn't say anything for a bit.`,
  `He crossed his legs, dabbed at his mouth with the napkin, and held Whitey's gaze for a bit, Sean thinking this was one of the things that had begun to bore him the most about his job— all these big-dick contests, everyone staring each other blind, nobody backing down. "Yes, Sergeant," Roman said, "I knew Katherine Marcus. Is that what you came here to ask?" Whitey shrugged. "I knew her, and I saw her in a bar last night." "And you exchanged words with her," Whitey said. "I did," Roman said. "What words?" Sean said. Roman kept his eyes on Whitey, as if Sean didn't rate any more acknowledgment than he'd already given. "She was dating a friend of mine. She was drunk. I told her she was making a fool of herself and she and her two friends should go home." "Who's your friend?" Whitey said. Roman smiled. "Come on, Sergeant. You know who it is." "So say the words." "Bobby O'Donnell," Roman said. "Happy? She was dating Bobby." "Currently?" "Excuse me?" "Currently," Whitey repeated. "She was currently dating him? Or she had once dated him?" "Currently," Roman said. Whitey scribbled in his notebook. "Goes against the information we have, Roman." "That so?" "Yeah. We heard she dumped his doughy ass seven months back, but he wouldn't let go." "You know women, Sergeant." Whitey shook his head. "No, Roman, why don't you tell me?" Roman closed his section of the paper. "She and Bobby went back and forth. One minute he was the love of her life, the next he was cooling his heels." "Cooling his heels," Whitey said to Sean. "That sound like the Bobby O'Donnell you know?" "Not at all," Sean said. "Not at all," Whitey said to Roman. Roman shrugged. "I'm telling you what I know.`,
  `That's all." "Fair enough." Whitey wrote in his notebook for a bit. "Roman, where'd you go last night after you left the Last Drop?" "We went to a party at a friend's loft downtown." "Oooh, a loft party," Whitey said. "Always wanted to go to one of those. Designer drugs, models, lots of white guys listening to rap, telling themselves how 'street' they are. By 'we,' Roman, you mean yourself and Ally McBeal over here?" "Michaela," Roman said. "Yes. Michaela Davenport if you're writing it down." "Oh, I'm writing it down," Whitey said. "Is that your real name, honey?" "What?" "Your real name," Whitey said, "is Michaela Davenport?" "Yes." The model's eyes bulged a little more. "Why?" "Your mother watch a lot of soaps before you were born?" Michaela said, "Roman." Roman held up a hand, looked at Whitey. "What I say about keeping this between us? Huh?" "You taking offense, Roman? You going to go all Christopher Walken on me, try to come on strong? Is that the idea? Because, I mean, we could go on a drive till your alibi clears. We could do that. You got plans for tomorrow?" Roman went back into that place Sean had seen most criminals go when a cop came down hard— a recession into self so total that you'd swear they'd stopped breathing, the eyes looking back at you, dark and disinterested and shrinking. "No offense, Sergeant," Roman said, his voice a flat line. "I'll be happy to provide you with the names of everyone who saw me at the party. And I'm sure the bartender at the Last Drop, Todd Lane, will verify that I left the bar no earlier than two." "Good boy," Whitey said. "Now what about your pal Bobby? Where can we find him?" Roman allowed himself a broad smile.`,
  `He clenched his hands together and rocked a bit in his chair. "Yeah, eight. We had a couple of slices at Hi-Fi, right? And then…then she had to go." Whitey jotted "Hi-Fi, 8p, Fri." in his report pad. "She had to go where?" "I dunno," Brendan said. The mother crushed another cigarette into the pile she'd built in the ashtray, igniting one of the dead cigarettes so that a stream of smoke pirouetted up from the pile and snaked into Sean's right nostril. Esther Harris immediately fired up another butt, and Sean got a mental image of her lungs— knotty and black as ebony. "Brendan, how old are you?" "Nineteen." "And when'd you graduate high school?" "Graduate," Esther said. "I, ah, got my GED last year," Brendan said. "So, Brendan," Whitey said, "you have no idea where Katie went Friday night after she left you at Hi-Fi?" "No," Brendan said, the word dying wet in his throat, his eyes beginning to grow red. "She'd dated Bobby and he was all psycho over her and then her father doesn't like me for some reason, so we had to keep the thing between us quiet. Sometimes she wouldn't tell me where she was going because it might be to meet Bobby, I guess, to try to convince him that they were over. I dunno. That night she just said she was going home." "Jimmy Marcus doesn't like you?" Sean said. "Why?" Brendan shrugged. "I have no idea. But he told Katie he never wanted her to see me." The mother said, "What? That thief thinks he's better than this family?" "He's not a thief," Brendan said. "He was a thief," the mother said. "You don't know that, huh, GED? He was a scumbag burglar from way back. His daughter probably had the gene in her.`,
  `"She was nice, sir. She was just a nice, nice person. Everyone liked her. I don't know what to tell you." The O'Shea kid said, "Can we, like, go now?" Whitey cocked an eyebrow at him. "Someone say you couldn't?" Johnny O'Shea and Ray Harris walked back out of the kitchen and they could hear them toss their skateboards to the floor of the living room, go back into Ray and Brendan's room, banging around into everything the way twelve-year-olds do. Whitey asked Brendan, "Where were you between one-thirty and three this morning?" "Asleep." Whitey looked at the mother. "Can you confirm that?" She shrugged. "Can't confirm he didn't climb out a window and down the fire escape. I can confirm he went into his room at ten o'clock and next I saw him was nine in the morning." Whitey stretched in his chair. "All right, Brendan. We're going to have to ask you to take a polygraph. You think you're up for that?" "Are you arresting me?" "No. Just want you to take a polygraph." Brendan shrugged. "Whatever. Sure." "And here, take my card." Brendan looked at the card. He kept his eyes on it when he said, "I loved her so much. I…I ain't ever going to feel that again. I mean, it don't happen twice, right?" He looked up at Whitey and Sean. His eyes were dry, but the pain in them was something Sean wanted to duck from. "It don't happen once, most cases," Whitey said. *** THEY DROPPED BRENDAN back at his place around one, the kid having aced the polygraph four times, and then Whitey dropped Sean back at his apartment, told him to get some sleep, they'd be up early. Sean walked into his empty apartment, heard the din of its silence, and felt the sludge of too much caffeine and fast food in his blood, riding his spinal column.`,
  `Laura? Erin? "Tell her I said hi, will you?" "Sure. You still with the Staties?" Dave squinted as the sun broke from behind a cloud and bounced hard off the shiny black trunk of the government sedan. "Yeah," Sean said. "Actually, this here is Sergeant Powers, Dave. My boss. State Police Homicide." Dave shook Sergeant Powers's hand, that word hanging between them. Homicide. "How you doing?" "Good, Mr. Boyle. Yourself?" "Okay." "Dave," Sean said, "you got a minute, we'd love to ask you a couple quick questions." "Uh, sure. What's up?" "We maybe go inside, Mr. Boyle?" Sergeant Powers tilted his head in the direction of Dave's front door. "Yeah, sure." Dave took Michael's hand again. "Follow me, guys." Heading up the stairs past McAllister's place, Sean said, "I hear rents are rising even here." "Even here," Dave said. "Trying to turn us into the Point, an antique shop on every fifth corner." "The Point, yeah," Sean said with a dry chuckle. "'Member my father's house? Cut it into condos." "No shit?" Dave said. "That was a beautiful house." "'Course he sold it before the market got hot." "And now it's condos?" Dave said, his voice loud in the narrow stairwell. He shook his head. "The yuppies who bought it probably get per unit what your old man sold the whole place for." "'Bout the size of it," Sean said. "What're you gonna do, right?" "I dunno, man, but I almost think there's gotta be a way to stop them. Send them back to wherever they grow them and their goddamn cell phones. Friend of mine said the other day, Sean? He said, 'What this neighborhood needs is a good fucking crime wave.'" Dave laughed. "I mean, that'd send property values back to where they belong. Rents, too. Right?" Sergeant Powers said, "Girls keep getting murdered in Pen Park, Mr.`,
  `"We're working on it. Believe that, Mr. Boyle." "How's Jimmy holding up?" Sean asked. "Hard to tell." Dave looked at Sean, happy to tear his eyes away from Sergeant Powers, something in the man's face he didn't like, the way the guy peered at you like he could see your lies, every one of them as far back as the first one you ever told in your goddamned life. "You know how Jimmy is," Dave said. "Not really. Not anymore." "Well, he still keeps it all in," Dave said. "No way to tell what's really going on up in that head of his." Sean nodded. "The reason we came by, Dave…" "I saw her," Dave said. "I don't know if you knew that." He looked at Sean and Sean opened his hands, waiting. "That night," Dave went on, "I guess it was the night she died, I saw her at McGills." Sean and the cop exchanged glances, and then Sean leaned forward, fixed Dave in a friendly gaze. "Well, yeah, Dave, that's actually what brought us here. Your name showed up on a list of people were in McGills that night to the best of the bartender's recollection. We hear Katie put on quite a show." Dave nodded. "She and a friend did some dancing on the bar." The cop said, "They were pretty drunk, huh?" "Yeah, but…" "But what?" "But it was a harmless kinda drunk. They were dancing, but they weren't stripping or nothing. They were just, I dunno, nineteen. You know?" "Nineteen and getting served in a bar means the bar loses its liquor license for a while," Sergeant Powers said. "You didn't?" "What's that?" "You never drank underage in a bar?" Sergeant Powers smiled, and the smile got into Dave's skull the same way the man's eyes did, as if every inch of the guy was peeping.`,
  `She— " "Her path consistently brought her deeper into the park," Maggie Mason said. "Yes, ma'am." "Why?" "Why?" "Yes, Sergeant." She removed her glasses and placed them on the table in front of her. "If I'm a woman being chased through a city park, whose terrain I'm familiar with, I may begin by leading my pursuer into it in the hopes he'll get lost or held up. But the moment I can, I'm going to start heading back out. Why didn't she cut north toward Roseclair, or double back toward Sydney? Why keep going deeper into the park?" "Shock, maybe. And fear. Fear makes people forget how to think. Let's remember, too, her blood alcohol level was at point-oh-nine. She was drunk." She shook her head. "I don't buy it. And here's something else— from your reports, am I to surmise that Miss Marcus was, in fact, faster than her pursuer?" Whitey's mouth opened a bit, but he seemed to forget what he was going to say. "Your report, Sergeant. It states that on at least two occasions, Miss Marcus seemed to choose hiding over running. She hid in the garden co-op. And she hid under the footbridge. That tells me two things— one, that she was faster than her pursuer, otherwise she wouldn't have had the time necessary to attempt to hide. And two, that she paradoxically felt that keeping ahead of her pursuer wasn't enough. You add that in with her lack of attempt to run back out of the park, and what does it tell you?" No one had an answer for that. Eventually, Friel said, "What does it tell you, Maggie?" "It presents the possibility to me, anyway, that she felt surrounded." For a minute, it seemed to Sean like the air in the room went static, popping with electrical currents.`,
  `"A gang or something?" Whitey said eventually. "Or something," she said. "I don't know, Sergeant. I'm just going on your report. I can't for the life of me understand why this woman, who apparently was faster than her attacker, would elect not to just run right back out of the park unless she thought someone else was flanking her." Whitey hung his head. "All due respect, ma'am, but there'd have been a hell of a lot more physical evidence on-scene in such a scenario." "You yourself cite the rain in your report several times." "Yes," Whitey said. "But if you got a gang of people— or hell, even two — chasing Katherine Marcus, we're going to see more than we did. At least a few more footprints. Something, ma'am." Maggie Mason put her glasses back on and looked down at the report in her hand. Eventually, she said, "It's a theory, Sergeant. One that I think, on the basis of your own report, bears looking into." Whitey kept his head down, though Sean could feel the contempt rising off his shoulders like sewer gas. "What about it, Sergeant?" Friel said. Whitey raised his head and gave them an exhausted smile. "I'll bear it in mind. I will. But gang activity in that neighborhood's at an all-time low. We pass on that, then we consider two guys as the perps, which brings us back to the possibility of a contract hit." "Okay…" "But if that's the case— and we all agreed at the outset here today that it was a long shot— then the second shooter would have emptied his piece the moment Katherine Marcus hit his partner with the door. The only way this makes sense is if it's one shooter and a panicked, drunken woman maybe growing faint with blood loss, not thinking clearly, and having a lot of bad luck." "But you'll bear my theory in mind, of course," Maggie Mason said with a bitter smile, her eyes on the table.`,
  `Just about anything they found in that car would be thrown out in court because Dave's lawyer could claim the car thieves had put it there. "The blood was old, Mr. Boyle. Older than a few hours." "Yeah?" Dave said. "You can prove that? I mean, conclusively, Sergeant? You're sure it didn't just dry fast? I mean, it wasn't a humid night last night." "We can prove it," Whitey said, but Sean could hear the doubt in his voice, so he was pretty sure Dave could hear it, too. Whitey got up off the table and turned his back to Dave. He put his fingers over his mouth and drummed them against his upper lip as he walked the length of the table down toward Sean's end, his eyes on the floor. "Things looking any better on that Sprite?" Dave said. *** "WE'RE BRINGING DOWN the kid Souza talked to, the one who saw the car. Tommy, ah— " "Moldanado," Sean said. "Yeah." Whitey nodded, his voice a little thin, his face a fist of distraction, the look of a guy who'd had a chair pulled out from under him, found his ass hitting the floor, wondering how he got there. "We'll, ah, put Boyle in a lineup, see if this Moldanado picks him out." "It's something," Sean said. Whitey leaned against the corridor wall as a secretary passed them, her perfume the same kind Lauren used, Sean thinking maybe he'd call her on her cell, see how she was doing today, see if she'd talk now that he'd made the first move. Whitey said, "He's too cool in there. Guy's first time in the box and he's not even sweating?" Sean said, "Sarge, it's not looking good, you know?" "No shit." "No, I mean, even if we didn't get blown out on the car, it's not the Marcus girl's blood.`,
  `He used to come in the house singing when he was drunk. He took me to Canobie Lake Park once and bought me cotton candy and I ate half of it and puked all over the teacup ride. He wasn't around a lot, I remember that. Why?" Sean's eyes were back on the screen. "What else you remember?" "I dunno. He smelled like Schlitz and Dentyne. He…" Sean could hear a smile in Brendan's voice and he looked up, caught it sliding softly across his face. "He what, Brendan?" Brendan shifted in his chair, his gaze fixed on something that wasn't in the squad room, wasn't even in the current time zone. "He used to carry all this change, you know? It weighed down his pockets, and he made noise when he walked. When I was a kid, I'd sit in the living room at the front of the house. It was a different place than where we live now. It was nice. And I'd sit there around five o'clock and keep my eyes closed until I heard him and his coins coming up the street. Then I'd bolt out of the house to see him, and if I could guess how much he had in one pocket— if I was even close, you know?— he'd give it to me." Brendan's smile widened and he shook his head. "The man had a lot of change." "What about a gun?" Sean said. "Your father have a gun?" The smile froze and Brendan's eyes narrowed at Sean like he didn't understand the language. "What?" "Did your father have a gun?" "No." Sean nodded and said. "You seem pretty sure for someone who was only six when he left." Connolly entered the squad room carrying a cardboard box. He walked over to Sean and placed the box on Whitey's desk.`,
  `He looked smaller and younger, but meaner, too, as if he'd seen things in there that he'd never wished to know existed. But Sean had been careful to have him tossed in an empty cell, away from the dregs and junkies, so he had no idea what could have been so horrible for him, unless he really couldn't handle isolation. "Where's your father?" Sean said. Brendan chewed a nail and shrugged. "New York." "Haven't seen him?" Brendan went to work on another nail. "Not since I was six." "Did you kill Katherine Marcus?" Brendan dropped the finger from his mouth and stared at Sean. "Answer me." "No." "Where's your father's gun?" "I don't know anything about my father having a gun." There was no blinking this time. He didn't avert his eyes from Sean's. He stared into Sean's face with a kind of cruel and beaten fatigue that allowed Sean to sense a potential for violence in the kid for the first time since he'd met him. What the hell had happened in that holding cell? Sean said, "Why would your father want to kill Katie Marcus?" "My father," Brendan said, "didn't kill anyone." "You know something, Brendan. And you're not telling me. Tell you what, let's see if the polygraph's free right now. We'll ask you a few more questions." Brendan said, "Let me talk to a lawyer." "In a minute. Let's— " Brendan repeated it. "Let me talk to a lawyer. Now." Sean kept his voice level. "Sure. You got anyone in mind?" "My mom knows one. Let me make my phone call." Sean said, "Look, Brendan— " "Now," Brendan said. Sean sighed and pushed his phone across the desk. "Dial nine first." *** BRENDAN'S LAWYER was an old Irish blowhard who'd been chasing ambulances since the days they'd been drawn by horses, but he'd been around enough to know Sean didn't have the right to hold his client on lack of alibi and nothing else.`,
  `He was having sex with a kid in his car. He was a vampire, Jim. He was poisoning that kid." "So it wasn't a mugger. It was some guy who, I get it, was molesting a kid. Of course, Dave. Sure. You killed this guy?" "Yeah. Well, me…me and the Boy." Dave had no idea why he'd said that. He'd never spoken of the Boy. You didn't do that. People didn't understand. Maybe it was the fear. Maybe it was a need for Jimmy to see into his head, to understand that, yes, it was a mess in there, but see me, Jimmy. Realize I'm not the kind of man who'd kill an innocent. "So, you and the molested kid went and— " "No," Dave said. "No what? You said that you and the boy— " "No, no. Forget that. My head gets fucked up sometimes. I say— " "No shit," Jimmy said. "So you killed a child molester. You're telling me this, but you don't tell your wife? I would think she'd be the first person you'd tell. Particularly last night, when she told you she didn't believe the mugger story. I mean, why not tell her? Most people don't really mind when a child molester dies, Dave. Your wife was thinking you killed my daughter. And you'd have me believe that you'd have preferred she thought that than think you killed a pedophile. Explain that to me, Dave." Dave wanted to say, I killed him because I was afraid I was turning into him. If I ate his heart I would subsume and submerge his spirit. But I can't say that aloud. I can't speak that truth. I know I swore today that there'd be no more secrets. But, come on, that secret has to stay one— no matter how many lies I have to tell to keep it buried.`,
  `"Come on, Dave. Just tell me why. Why couldn't you tell your own wife the, ah, truth?" And the best Dave could come up with was "I don't know." "You don't know. Okay, so in this fairy tale, you and the kid— what's he supposed to be, you when you were a kid?— you and him go and— " "It was just me," Dave said. "I killed the faceless creature." "The fucking what?" Val said. "The guy. The molester. I killed him. Me. Just me. In the parking lot of the Last Drop." Jimmy said, "I didn't hear of any dead guys found near the Last Drop," and looked over at Val. Val said, "Letting this bag of shit explain, Jim? What're you kidding me?" "No, it's the truth," Dave said. "I swear on my son. I put the guy in the trunk of his car. I don't know what happened to the car, but I did, I swear to God. I want to see my wife, Jimmy. I want to live my life." Dave looked up at the dark underside of the bridge, heard the tires slapping away up there, the yellow lights streaming home. "Jimmy? Please, don't take that from me." Jimmy looked in Dave's face and Dave saw his death there. It lived in Jimmy like the wolves. Dave wished so hard that he could face this. But he couldn't. He couldn't face dying. He stood here now— right now with his feet on this pavement, his heart pumping blood, his brain sending messages to his nerves and muscles and organs, his adrenal glands open wide— and any second, it could be the very next one, a blade would plunge through his chest. And within all that pain would come the certainty that this life— his life and his vision and his eating and lovemaking and laughing and touch and smell— would end.`,
  `"Come on," Brendan said. "Who do you hate?" Ray's sign was brief: "Nobody." Brendan nodded. "Okay. Who do you love?" Ray gave him that face again. Brendan leaned forward, his hands on his knees. "Who do you love?" Ray looked down at his shoes, then up at Brendan. He raised his hand and pointed at his brother. "You love me?" Ray nodded, fidgeting. "What about Ma?" Ray shook his head. "You don't love Ma?" Ray signed, "Don't feel one way or the other." "So I'm the only person you love?" Ray thrust his small face out and scowled. His hands flew. "Yes. Can I go now?" "No," Brendan said. "Have a seat." Ray looked down at the chair, his face red and angry. He looked up at Brendan. He raised his hand and extended his middle finger, and then he turned to walk out of the kitchen. Brendan didn't even realize he'd moved until he had most of Ray's hair in his hand and was pulling him up off his feet. He pulled back with his arm as if he were pulling the cord on a rusty lawn mower, and then he opened his fingers and Ray flew backward out of his hand and over the kitchen table. He hit the wall and then dropped onto the table, brought the whole thing crashing to the floor with him. "You love me?" Brendan said, not even looking down at his brother. "You love me so you kill my fucking girlfriend, Ray? Huh?" That got Johnny O'Shea moving, as Brendan had figured it would. Johnny grabbed his gym bag and bolted for the door, but Brendan was all over him. He picked the little prick up by his throat and slammed him against the door. "My brother never does anything without you, O'Shea.`,
