  `"Where are you?" "I'm…Look…I'm on Sydney Street." "What's wrong?" "They found her car, Annabeth." "Whose car?" "Katie's." "They? The police? They?" "Yeah. She's…missing. In Pen Park somewhere." "Oh, Jesus God. No, right? No. No, Jimmy." Jimmy felt it fill him now— that dread, that awful certainty, the horror of thoughts he'd kept clenched behind a shelf in his brain. "We don't know anything yet. But her car's been here all night and the cops— " "Jesus Christ, Jimmy." "— are searching the park for her. Tons of them. So…" "Where are you?" "I'm on Sydney. Look— " "On the fucking street? Why aren't you in there?" "They won't let me in." "They? Who the fuck are they? Is she their daughter?" "No. Look, I— " You get in there. Jesus. She could be hurt. Lying in there somewhere, all cold and hurt." "I know, but they— " "I'm on my way." "Okay." "Get in there, Jimmy. I mean, God, what's wrong with you?" She hung up. Jimmy handed the phone back to Chuck, knowing that Annabeth was right. She was so completely right that it killed Jimmy to realize that he would regret his impotence of the last forty-five minutes for the rest of his life, never be able to think about it without cringing, trying to crawl away from it in his head. When had he become this thing— this man who'd say yes, sir, no, sir, right you are, sir, to fucking cops when his firstborn daughter was missing? When had that happened? When had he stood at a counter and handed his dick over in exchange for feeling like, what, an upright citizen? He turned to Chuck. "You still keep those bolt cutters under the spare in your trunk?" Chuck got a look on his face like he'd been caught doing something.`,
  `It had been taken a few years ago, Katie's smile tight around her braces as she sat on her father's shoulders. Jimmy held her ankles in his hands and looked into the camera with that wonderfully open smile he had, the one that could surprise you if only because so little about Jimmy seemed open, and the smile was one place where his reserve failed to reach. She was picking the picture up off the nightstand when she heard Dave's voice from the pavement below: "You two again." And she'd sat there, dying in increments, as she heard Dave and the policemen talk, and then heard what Sean Devine and his partner said after Dave had crossed the street to get Annabeth's cigarettes. For ten or twelve horrible seconds, she almost vomited on Katie's blue dress. Her diaphragm lurched up and down and her throat constricted, and the contents of her stomach boiled. She bent in half, trying to hold it in, and a hoarse hacking noise escaped her lips several times, but she didn't throw up. And it passed. She still felt nauseous, though. Nauseous and clammy, and her brain seemed to have caught fire. It burned, something raging in there, dimming the lights, filling her sinuses and the spaces immediately behind her eyes. She lay back on the bed as Sean and his partner ascended the stairs, and she wished to be struck by lightning or have the ceiling cave in on her or to simply be lifted by some unknown force and tossed out the open window. All of these scenarios were preferable to the one she found herself facing now. But maybe he was merely protecting someone else, or maybe he had seen something he shouldn't have and he'd been threatened. Maybe the police questioning him meant only that they considered him a suspect.`,
  `He laughed so hard that tears sprang from his eyes, and his entire upper body shook. "I…I…I…I…" He couldn't get it out. The laughter was too strong. It rolled over him and out of him again and the tears came hard now, pouring down his cheeks and into his open mouth, bubbling on his lips. It was official: Celeste had never been more terrified in her life. "Ha-ha-ha-Henry," he said, the laughter finally trailing off into chuckles. "What?" "Henry," he said. "Henry and George, Celeste. Those were their names. Isn't that fucking hilarious? And George, lemme tell ya, he was curious. Henry, though, Henry was just flat-out mean." "What are you talking about?" "Henry and George," he said brightly. "I'm talking about Henry and George. They took me for a ride. A four-day ride. And they buried me in a cellar with this old ratty sleeping bag on a stone floor, and, man, Celeste, did they have their fucking fun. No one came to help old Dave then. No one burst in to rescue Dave. Dave had to pretend it was happening to someone else. He had to get so fucking strong in his mind that he could split it in two. That's what Dave did. Hell, Dave died. The kid who came out of that cellar, I don't know who the fuck he was— well, he's me, actually— but he's sure as shit not Dave. Dave's dead." Celeste couldn't speak. In eight years, Dave had never talked about what everyone knew had happened to him. He'd told her he'd been playing with Sean and Jimmy and he'd been abducted and he'd escaped and that was all he was ever going to say. She'd never heard the names of the men. She'd never heard about the sleeping bag. She'd never heard any of this.`,
  `"I don't know what all this means exactly, but it's beginning to bug me, yeah." Celeste felt a momentary wash of pity for her husband as she pictured him in some police interrogation room, perhaps handcuffed to a table, a harsh light in his pale face. Then she saw the Dave who'd craned his head around the door last night and looked at her, tilted and crazed, and fear overrode pity. She took a deep breath, let it out. "At three in the morning on Sunday, Dave came back to our apartment covered in someone else's blood." It was out there now. The words had left her mouth and entered the atmosphere. They formed a wall in front of her and Jimmy and then that wall sprouted a ceiling and another wall behind them and they were suddenly cloistered within a tiny cell created by a single sentence. The noises along the avenue died and the breeze vanished, and all Celeste could smell was Jimmy's cologne and the bright May sun baked into the steps at their feet. When he spoke, Jimmy sounded like someone's hand clenched his throat. "What did he say happened?" She told him. She told him everything, up to and including last night's vampire madness. She told him, and she saw that every word out of her mouth became just one more word he wanted to hide from. They burned him. They entered his skin like darts. His mouth and eyes curled back from them, and the skin tightened on his face until she could see the skeleton underneath, and her body temperature dropped at an image of him lying in a coffin with long, pointed fingernails and a crumbling jaw, flowing moss for hair. And when the tears began to fall silently down his cheeks, she resisted the urge to press his face to her neck, to feel those tears leak into her blouse and down her back.`,
  `I'd drop into space and float away, keep floating for a million years, out in all that cold. And when Ray went under, that's what I thought of. That he'd just keep sinking till he popped out through a hole in the planet and sank through a million years of space." Dave said, "I know you're thinking something here, Jimmy, but you're wrong. You think I killed Katie, don't you? Is that it?" Jimmy said, "Don't talk, Dave." "No, no, no," Dave said, noticing the gun in Val's hand suddenly. "I didn't have anything to do with Katie's death." They're going to kill me, Dave realized. Oh, Jesus, no. This is something you have to be able to prepare for. You don't just step outside a bar to throw up and turn around to realize it's the end of your life. No. I'm supposed to go home. I'm supposed to make things right with Celeste. I'm supposed to eat that meal. Jimmy reached into his jacked and came back out with a knife in his hand. His hand was trembling a bit as he pulled the blade open. So was his upper lip and part of his chin, Dave realized. There was hope. Don't let the brain freeze up. There's hope. "You came home the night Katie died with blood all over your clothes, Dave. You told two different stories about how you fucked up your hand, and your car was seen outside the Last Drop around the time Katie left. You lied to the cops and you've been lying to everyone else." "Look, Jimmy. Please look at me." Jimmy kept his eyes on the ground. "Jimmy, I had blood on me, yeah. I beat someone, Jimmy. Beat him bad." "Oh, is this the mugger story?" Jimmy said. "No. He was a child molester.`,
  `He couldn't see Jimmy, though Jimmy had been right beside him the whole time. He could just see that seat and Dave and the door and the trash on the floor. That, he realized, had been the alarm bell he hadn't even realized he'd heard— there had been trash on the floor. Fast-food wrappers and crinkled-up bags of chips and beer and soda cans, Styrofoam coffee cups and a dirty green T-shirt. Only after he'd woken up and considered the dream did he realize that the floor of the backseat in his dream had been identical to the floor of the car in real life, and that he hadn't remembered the trash until now. Even when the cops had been in his house and asked him to think— really think— about any detail he might have forgotten to tell them, it hadn't occurred to him that the back of the car had been dirty, because he hadn't remembered it. But in his dream, it had come back to him, and that— more than anything— had been why he'd realized, without realizing it, somehow, that something was wrong about the "cop," his "partner," and their car. Sean had never seen the backseat of a cop car in real life, not up close, but a part of him knew that it wouldn't be filled with trash. Maybe underneath all the trash had lain halfeaten apple cores, and that's why the car smelled as it had. His father would come into his bedroom a year after Dave's abduction to tell him two things. The first was that Sean had been accepted to Latin School, and would begin seventh grade there in September. His father said he and Sean's mother were real proud. Latin was where you went if you wanted to make something out of yourself.`,
  `Jimmy watched the driver floor it, heard the big engine rev as the cruiser shot down Roseclair toward the Pen Channel. A black unmarked followed a few seconds later, its sirens mute but no mistaking it for anything else, the driver cutting the hard ninety-degree turn onto Roseclair at forty miles an hour, engine humming. And as Jimmy lowered Nadine back to the ground, he could feel it in his blood, a sudden, mean certainty, a sense of things falling miserably into place. He watched the two cop cars zip under the overpass and turn hard right onto the entrance road of Pen Park, and he felt Katie in his blood now along with that humming engine and slapping tires, the floating capillaries and cells. Katie, he almost said aloud. Sweet Jesus. Katie. 8 OLD MACDONALD CELESTE WOKE UP Sunday morning thinking about pipes— the network of them that coursed through homes and restaurants, movie multiplexes and shopping malls, and dropped in great skeletal sections from the tops of forty-story office buildings, floor by giant floor, plunging toward an even grander network of sewers and aqueducts that ran beneath cities and towns, connecting people more viably than language, with the sole purpose of flushing the things we'd consumed and rejected from our bodies, our lives, our dishes and crisper trays. Where did it all go? She supposed she'd considered the question before, in a vague sense, the way you wondered how a plane really stayed aloft without flapping its wings, but now she really wanted to know. She sat up in the empty bed, anxious and curious, heard the sounds of Dave and Michael playing Wiffle ball in the backyard three stories below. Where? she wondered. It had to go somewhere. All those flushes, all that hand soap and shampoo and detergent and toilet paper and barroom vomit, all the coffee stains, bloodstains, and sweat stains, dirt from the cuffs of your pants and grime from the inside of your collar, the cold vegetables you scraped off the plate into the garbage disposal, cigarettes and urine and hard bristles of hair from legs, cheeks, groins, and chins— it all met up with hundreds of thousands of similar or identical entities every night and poured, she assumed, through dank corridors fleeced by vermin and out into vast catacombs where it commingled in rushing water that rushed off to… where?`,
  `But last night— last night had definitely been main event/title card sort of passion, leaving her, even now as she lay in the bed, bruised to the marrow with it. It was when she heard Dave's voice from outside again, telling Michael to concentrate, concentrate, damn it, that she remembered what had been bothering her— before the pipes, before the memory of their crazy kitchen sex, maybe even before she'd crawled into bed this morning: Dave had lied to her. She'd known in the bathroom when he'd first come home, but she'd decided to ignore it. Then, as she'd lain on the linoleum and raised her back and ass off the floor so he could enter her, she'd known it again. She watched his eyes, slightly glazed, as he inserted himself and pulled her calves over his hips, and she met his initial thrusts with the dawning certainty that his story didn't make sense. For starters, who said things like, "Your wallet or your life, bitch. I'm leaving with one of them"? It was laughable. It was, as she had been sure in the bathroom, movie talk. And even if the mugger had prepared the line beforehand, no way he'd actually say it when the time came. No way. Celeste had been mugged once on the Common when she was in her late teens. The mugger, a high-yellow black man with flat, thin wrists and swimming brown eyes, had stepped up to her in the abandonment of a cold, late dusk, placed a switchblade to her hip, and let her see a glimpse of his winter eyes before he whispered, "Whatcha got?" There had been nothing around them but trees stripped by December, the closest person a businessman hurrying home along Beacon on the other side of a wrought-iron fence, twenty yards away.`,
  `Dave, never a football player himself, agreed after only ten minutes of perfunctory argument. So now they were out buying equipment so Michael could be a mirror of his old man, and Celeste stared at the TV, iron held stationary a few inches above a cotton shirt as a dog food commercial ended and the news returned. "Last night in Allston," the newscaster said, and Celeste's heart sank, "a BC sophomore was assaulted by two men outside this popular nightspot. Sources say the victim, Carey Whitaker, was beaten with a beer bottle and is listed in critical condition at…" She pretty much knew then, as small clumps of wet sand drizzled inside her chest, that she wasn't going to see anything on the assault or murder of a man outside the Last Drop. And once they turned to weather with a promise of sports to follow, she knew beyond any doubt. By now, they would have found the man. If he'd died ("Honey, I may have killed a man"), the reporters would have picked up on it through sources at the precinct house, off the police blotter, or simply by monitoring the police radios. So maybe Dave had overestimated the fury of his violence against the mugger. Maybe the mugger— or whoever it had been— had simply crawled off somewhere to lick his wounds after Dave left. Maybe those hadn't been pieces of brain she'd watched swirl down the drain last night. But all that blood? How could someone lose all that blood from his head and survive, never mind walk away? Once she'd ironed the last pair of pants and put everything away in either Michael's closet or hers and Dave's, she returned to the kitchen and stood in the center of it, not sure what to do next.`,
  `Golf played on the TV now, the soft thwacks of the ball and the dry, muted cackles of applause temporarily calming something inside of her that had been itchy all morning. It went beyond her problems with Dave and the holes in his story, yet had something to do with that at the same time, something to do with last night and the sight of him coming through the bathroom door with blood on him, all that blood on his pants staining the tile, bubbling in his wound, turning pink as it swirled down the drain. The drain. That was it. That's what she'd forgotten. Last night, she'd told Dave she would bleach out the inside of the drainpipe under the sink, eradicate the rest of the evidence. She went to it immediately, dropped to her knees on the kitchen floor and opened the cupboard underneath, stared in at the cleaning supplies and rags until she saw the lug wrench near the back. She reached back there, trying to ignore the phobia she had about reaching into the sink cupboard, an irrational feeling she always got that a rat lay waiting under the pile of rags, sniffing the air at the scent of her flesh, raising its snout from the rags now, whiskers twitching… She snatched the lug wrench out, then rattled it through the rags and cans of cleanser just to be sure, quite aware that her fear was silly, but determined nonetheless, because, hey, that's why they called them phobias. She hated sticking her hand into low, dark places; Rosemary had been terrified of elevators; her father had hated heights; Dave broke out into cold sweats whenever he had to descend into the cellar. She placed a bucket under the drainpipe to catch any excess runoff. She lay on her back and reached up, loosened the trap plug with the wrench, and then twisted with her hand until it came free and water came with it, splashing down into the plastic bucket.`,
  `She paused then, thinking it strange that it had reminded her of an old man's neck. Where had that come from? And she noticed that the TV had gone blank. One moment Tiger Woods was stalking the green, the next the screen was black. Then a white line blipped up the screen, and Celeste knew that if this TV had blown a picture tube, too, it was going off the porch. Right now, fuck the consequences, it was going. But the white line gave way to the newsroom studio, and the anchorwoman, looking rushed and harried, said, "We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a breaking story. Valerie Corapi is on the scene outside Penitentiary Park in East Buckingham, where police have launched a massive search for a missing woman. Valerie?" Celeste watched as the studio shot gave way to a helicopter shot— a jerky overhead view of Sydney Street and Penitentiary Park and what looked like an invading army of police milling around outside. She saw dozens of small figures, black as ants from the distance, walking through the park, and police boats on the channel. She saw a line of the antlike figures moving steadily toward the grove of trees that surrounded the old drive-in screen. The helicopter was buffeted by wind and the camera lens shifted, and for a moment Celeste was looking at the land on the other side of the channel, at Shawmut Boulevard and its stretch of industrial parks. "This is the scene here in East Buckingham right now where police arrived early this morning and commenced a large-scale search for a missing woman that continues now into the early afternoon. Unconfirmed sources have told News Four that the woman's abandoned car showed signs of foul play. Now, this, Virginia, is— I don't know if you can see it yet…" The helicopter camera turned away from the industrial parks on Shawmut in a nauseating one-eighty and pointed down at a dark blue car with its door open that sat on Sydney Street, looking somehow forlorn as police backed a tow truck up to it.`,
  `"Hundred percent positive?" the assistant ME asked. "Ninety-nine," Sean said. "We'll have the father do a positive at the morgue. But, yeah, it's her." "You see the back of her head?" Whitey leaned in and lifted the hair off her shoulders with a pen. Sean peered back there, saw that a small piece of the lower skull was missing, the back of the neck gone dark with the blood. "You telling me she was shot?" He looked at the ME. The guy nodded. "That looks like a bullet wound to me." Sean leaned back out of the smell of perfume and blood and mildewed concrete and sodden wood. He wished, for just a moment, that he could pull Katie Marcus's clenched fist down from her ear, as if by doing so those bruises he could see and the ones they were sure to find under her clothes would evaporate, and the red rain would ascend from her hair and body, and she would step back out of this tomb blinking sleep from her eyes, a bit groggy. Off to his right, he heard the sounds of a commotion, several people yelling at once, the rustle of mad scrambling, and the K-9 dogs snarling and barking in a mad fury. When he looked over, he saw Jimmy Marcus and Chuck Savage burst through the trees at the far side of the grove, where the land turned green and manicured and sloped gracefully down toward the screen, the place where summer crowds spread their blankets and sat in the grass to watch a play. At least eight uniforms and two plainclothes converged on Jimmy and Chuck, and Chuck went down right away, but Jimmy was fast and Jimmy was slippery. He slid straight through the line with a series of quick, seemingly illogical pivots that left his pursuers grasping air, and if he hadn't stumbled coming down the slope, he would have made the screen with no one to stop him but Krauser and Friel.`,
  `"You're going to love this." "What's that, Roman?" "If you're liking Bobby for Katherine Marcus's death, I mean, you're really going to love this." Roman flicked his predator's glance in Sean's direction, and Sean felt the excitement he'd felt since Eve Pigeon had mentioned Roman and Bobby wither. "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby." Roman sighed and winked at his girlfriend before turning back to Sean and Whitey. "Bobby was pulled over on a DUI Friday night." Roman took another sip of his latte, drawing it out. "He's been in jail all weekend, Sergeant." He wiggled his finger back and forth between the two of them. "Don't you guys check these things?" *** SEAN WAS FEELING the day in his bones, sucking at the marrow, by the time the troopers radioed that Brendan Harris had returned to his apartment with his mother. Sean and Whitey got there at eleven, sat in the kitchen with Brendan and his mother, Esther, Sean thinking, They don't make apartments like this anymore, thank God. It was like something out of an old TV show— The Honeymooners, maybe— as if it could only be truly appreciated seen in black and white through a thirteen-inch picture tube that cackled with electricity and watery reception. It was a railroad apartment; the entrance doorway had been cut dead in the center so that you walked out of the stairwell and into a living room. Past the living room on the right was a small dining room that Esther Harris used as her bedroom, stacking her brushes and combs and assorted powders in the crumbling butler's pantry. Beyond that was the bedroom Brendan shared with his little brother, Raymond. To the left of the living room was a short hallway with a lopsided bathroom branching off it on the right, and then the kitchen, tucked back there where the light reached for a total of maybe forty-five minutes in the late afternoon.`,
  `She would've been just as bad. Count yourself lucky, son." Sean and Whitey shot each other looks. Esther Harris was quite possibly the most miserable woman Sean had ever met. She was fucking evil. Brendan Harris opened his mouth to say something to his mother, then closed it back up again. Whitey said, "Katie had brochures for Las Vegas in her backpack. We hear she was planning to go there. With you, Brendan." "We…" Brendan kept his head down. "We, yeah, we were going to Vegas. We were going to get married. Today." He raised his head and Sean watched the tears bubble in the red undercarriage of his eyes. Brendan wiped at them with the back of his hand before they could fall, and said, "I mean, that was the plan, right?" "You were going to leave me?" Esther Harris said. "Just leave without a word?" "Ma, I— " "Like your father? That it? Leave me with your little brother never says a word? That's what you were going to do, Brendan?" "Mrs. Harris," Sean said, "if we could just concentrate on the issue at hand. There'll be plenty of time for Brendan to explain later." She threw a glance at Sean that he'd seen on a lot of hardened cons and nine-to-five sociopaths, a look that said he wasn't worth her attention right now, but if he continued to push it, she'd deal with him in a way that'd leave bruises. She looked back at her son. "You'd do this to me? Huh?" "Ma, look…" "Look what? Look what, huh? What'd I do that was so bad? Huh? What did I do but raise you and feed you and buy you that saxophone for Christmas you never learned how to play? Thing's still in the closet, Brendan." "Ma— " "No, go get it.`,
  `But there is one helluva causal connection between him in that car when Katie Marcus left the bar." He clapped Sean's shoulder. "Come on, let's go up." Sean took a last look across the avenue as Dave handed cash to the clerk in the liquor store. He felt sorry for Dave. No matter what he may have done, Dave just elicited that in a person— pity, unrefined and a little bit ugly, sharp as shale. *** CELESTE, sitting on Katie's bed, heard the policemen coming up the stairs, their heavy shoes tramping up the old risers just on the other side of the wall. Annabeth had sent her in here a few minutes ago to get a dress of Katie's that Jimmy could bring over to the funeral home, Annabeth apologizing for not being strong enough to go in the room herself. It was a blue dress with an off-the-shoulder cut to it, and Celeste remembered when Katie had worn it to Carla Eigen's wedding, a blue-and-yellow flower pinned to the side of her upswept hair just over the ear. She'd literally caused a few gasps that day, Celeste knowing she herself had never looked that good in her life, and Katie so completely unaware of just how dazzling her beauty was. The moment Annabeth had mentioned a blue dress, Celeste knew exactly which one she wanted. So she'd come in here, where last night she'd seen Jimmy holding Katie's pillow to his face, breathing her in, and she'd opened the windows to clear the room of the musty scent of loss. She'd found the dress zipped up in a garment bag in the back of the closet, and she'd taken it out and sat on the bed for a moment. She could hear the sounds of the avenue below— the snap of car doors shutting, the stray, fading chatter of people walking along the sidewalks, the hiss of a bus as it opened its doors at the corner of Crescent— and she looked at a photograph of Katie and her father on Katie's nightstand.`,
  `Jesus Christ. Dave killed Katie. Oh, dear God. Dave killed Katie, and I want to die. *** "SO YOU'VE DISCOUNTED Bobby and Roman as suspects?" Jimmy said. Sean shook his head. "Not completely. It doesn't rule out the possibility that they hired someone." Annabeth said, "But I can see it in your face, you don't think that's likely." "No, Mrs. Marcus, we don't." Jimmy said, "So who do you suspect? Anyone?" Whitey and Sean looked at each other, and then Dave came into the kitchen, unwrapping the cellophane from a pack of cigarettes, and handed them to Annabeth. "Here you go, Anna." "Thank you." She looked at Jimmy with a minor embarrassment in her face. "I just got the urge." He smiled softly and patted her hand. "Honey, whatever you need right now is fine. It's cool." She turned to Whitey and Sean as she lit up. "I quit ten years ago." "Me, too," Sean said. "Can I bum one?" Annabeth laughed, the cigarette jerking between her lips, and Jimmy thought it may have been the first beautiful sound he'd heard in twenty-four hours. He saw the grin on Sean's face as he took a cigarette from his wife, and he wanted to thank him for making her smile. "You're a bad boy, Trooper Devine." Annabeth lit his cigarette. Sean took a puff. "I've heard that before." "Heard it last week from the commander," Whitey said, "if I remember right." Annabeth said, "Really?" and fixed Sean in the warmth of her interest, Annabeth being one of those rare people who could invest as much effort in her listening as in her talking. Sean's grin widened as Dave took a seat, and Jimmy could feel the air in the kitchen grow lighter. "I'm just coming off a suspension," Sean admitted. "Yesterday was my first day back." "What did you do?" Jimmy said, leaning into the table.`,
  `Sean didn't ask which one. "Jimmy told me you said Katie was planning to elope with Brendan Harris." Sean nodded. "Well, that's just it, isn't it?" He turned in his chair. "What?" She blew a stream of smoke up at the empty clotheslines. "These silly dreams you have when you're young. I mean, what, Katie and Brendan Harris were going to make a life in Las Vegas? How long would that little Eden have lasted? Maybe they'd be on their second trailer park, second kid, but it would hit them sooner or later— life isn't happily ever after and golden sunsets and shit like that. It's work. The person you love is rarely worthy of how big your love is. Because no one is worthy of that and maybe no one deserves the burden of it, either. You'll be let down. You'll be disappointed and have your trust broken and have a lot of real sucky days. You lose more than you win. You hate the person you love as much as you love him. But, shit, you roll up your sleeves and work— at everything— because that's what growing older is." "Annabeth," Sean said, "anyone ever tell you that you're a hard woman?" She turned her head to him, her eyes closed, a dreamy smile on her face. "All the time." *** BRENDAN HARRIS went into his room that night and faced the suitcase under his bed. He'd packed it tightly with shorts and Hawaiian shirts, one sportcoat and two pairs of jeans, but no sweaters or wool pants. He'd packed what he'd expected they wore in Las Vegas, no winter clothes, because he and Katie had agreed that they never wanted to face another windchill or thermal-sock sale at Kmart or windshield crusted with ice. So when he opened the suitcase, what stared back up at him was a bright array of pastels and floral patterns, an explosion of summer.`,
  `And Sean, feeling it through his whole body, said, "I'd like to talk to you about some lug nuts." Barnes broke right there in his doorway, told Sean he'd just meant to fuck the guy's car up a little, give him a scare, the two of them having gotten into it a week before in the merge lane heading into the airport tunnel, Barnes so pissed by the end of it that he hung back, skipped his appointment, and followed Edwin Hurka home, waited till the guy had shut off all the lights in his house before he went to work with his tire iron. People were stupid. They killed each other over the dumbest things and then they hung around hoping to get caught, walked into court pleading not guilty after giving some cop a four-page, signed confession. It was knowing how stupid they really were that was a cop's best weapon. Let them talk. Always. Let them explain. Let them unload their guilt as you plied them with coffee and the tape recorder reels spun. And when they asked for a lawyer— and the average citizen almost always asked— you frowned and asked if they were sure that's what they wanted and let a very unfriendly vibe fill the room until they decided that they'd really like all three of you to be friends, so maybe they'd talk a bit more before they brought that lawyer down here and spoiled the mood. Dave didn't ask for a lawyer, though. Not once. He sat in the chair that bucked when you leaned too far back in it, and he looked hungover and annoyed and pissed at Sean, in particular, but he didn't look scared and he didn't look nervous, and Sean could tell it was beginning to get to Whitey.`,
  `And yet even at the craziest times, there was this stillness, these sudden pauses of self-reflection, this sense one got from him, even when he was a boy, that he carefully considered everything with the exception of his own skin. He turned and lightly slapped her knee with the back of his hand. "So what's up, dude? You look, uh…" "You can say it." "What? No, you look, well, a little tired is all." He leaned back on the step and sighed. "Hell, I guess we all do, right?" "I spent last night at a motel. With Michael." Jimmy stared straight ahead. "Okay." "I dunno, Jim. I may have left Dave for good." She noticed a change in his face, a setting of the jawbone, and she suddenly had the feeling Jimmy knew what she was going to say. "You left Dave." His voice was a monotone now, his gaze on the avenue. "Yeah. He's been acting, well…He's been acting nuts lately. He's not himself. He's starting to frighten me." Jimmy turned to her then and the smile on his face was so icy she almost slapped it with her hand. In his eyes, she could see the boy who'd climbed those telephone poles in the rain. "Why don't you start from the beginning?" he said. "When Dave started acting different." She said, "What do you know, Jimmy?" "Know?" "You know something. You're not surprised." The ugly smile faded and Jimmy leaned forward, his hands entwined in his lap. "I know he was taken in by the police this morning. I know he's got a foreign car with a dent in the front passenger quarter. I know he told me one story about how he fucked up his hand and he told the police another. And I know he saw Katie the night she died, but he didn't tell me that until after the police had questioned him about it." He unlocked his hands and spread them.`,
  `"Her," he said. "What?" Whitey looked over at him. "The kid on the tape. He said, 'her name.' 'He wants to know her name.' Talking about the Marcus girl." "Right," Whitey said. "Dead girl, you refer to her as a 'she.'" "But how the hell's he know that?" "Who?" "The kid who made the call. How's he know the blood in that car came from a woman?" Whitey's foot came off the desk and he looked at the box. He reached in and took out the tape. He flicked his wrist and Sean caught the tape in his hand. "Play it again," Whitey said. 26 LOST IN SPACE DAVE AND VAL passed through the city and drove over the Mystic River to this dive bar in Chelsea where the beer was cheap and cold and there wasn't much of a crowd, just a few old-timers who looked like they'd worked the waterfront their whole lives and four construction workers who were having an argument about someone named Betty who apparently had great tits but a bad attitude. The bar was tucked under the Tobin Bridge with its back against the Mystic, and it looked like it had been there going back several decades. Everyone knew Val and said their hellos. The owner, a skeletal guy with the blackest hair and the whitest skin, was named Huey. He worked the bar and gave them their first two rounds on the house. Dave and Val shot pool for a while, and then settled into a booth with a pitcher and two shots. The small square windows fronting the street had turned from gold to indigo, the night having dropped in so quickly, Dave felt almost bullied by it. Val was actually a pretty easygoing guy when you got to know him. He told stories about prison and thefts that had gone awry, and they were all kind of scary, actually, but somehow Val made them funny, too.`,
  `I wish it hadn't been you, Dave. I really do. He raised the pint to Katie. Daddy got him, honey. Daddy put him down. "Talking to yourself?" Jimmy looked over and saw Sean climbing out of his car. Sean had a roadie beer in his hand and he smiled at Jimmy's pint. "What's your excuse?" "Tough night," Jimmy said. Sean nodded. "Me, too. Saw a bullet with my name on it." Jimmy slid to the side, and Sean sat down beside him. "How'd you know to look for me here?" "Your wife said you might be here." "My wife?" Jimmy had never told her about his trips here. Christ, she was a real piece of work. "Yeah. Jimmy, we made a bust today." Jimmy took a long pull from the bottle, his chest fluttering. "A bust." "Yeah. We got your daughter's killers. Got 'em cold." "Killers?" Jimmy said. "Plural?" Sean nodded. "Kids, actually. Thirteen years old. Ray Harris's son, Ray junior, and a kid named Johnny O'Shea. They confessed half an hour ago." Jimmy felt a knife enter his brain through the ear and push toward the other side. A hot knife, slicing away through his skull. "No question?" he said. "None," Sean said. "Why?" "Why'd they do it? They don't even know. They were playing with a gun. They saw a car coming, and one of them lay down in the middle of the street. The car swerves, clutch kicks out, and O'Shea runs up to the car with the gun, says he just meant to scare her. Instead the gun went off. Katie hit him with the door, and the kids say they snapped. They chased her so she wouldn't tell anyone they had a gun." "And the beating they gave her?" Jimmy said, and took another drink.`,
  `"Ray junior had a hockey stick. He wouldn't answer any questions. He's mute, you know? Just sat there. But O'Shea said that they beat her because she'd made them mad by running." He shrugged as if the utter wastefulness of it surprised even him. "Little fucking kids," he said. "Afraid they'd get grounded or something, so they killed her." Jimmy stood. He opened his mouth to gulp some air and his legs gave way and he found himself right back on the step. Sean put a hand on his elbow. "Go easy, Jim. Take a few breaths." Jimmy saw Dave sitting on the ground, fingering the slice Jimmy had drawn from one end of his abdomen to the other. He heard his voice: Look at me, Jimmy. Look at me. And Sean said, "I got a call from Celeste Boyle. She said Dave's missing. She said she went a little crazy the last few days. She said you, Jim, might know where he is." Jimmy tried to speak. He opened his mouth, but his windpipe filled right up with what felt like damp cotton swabs. Sean said, "No one else knows where Dave could be. And it's important we talk to him, Jim, because he might know something about a guy who got killed outside the Last Drop the other night." "A guy?" Jimmy managed before his windpipe closed up again. "Yeah," Sean said, something hard finding his voice. "A pedophile with three priors. Real piece of shit. The theory at the barracks is that someone caught him in the act with a little kid and canceled his fucking ticket. So anyway," Sean said, "we want to talk to Dave about it. You know where he is, Jim?" Jimmy shook his head, having trouble seeing anything out of his peripheral vision now, a tunnel seeming to have formed in front of his eyes.`,
  `He told his wife that loving Katie and protecting Katie were the core of him, and when she had been taken, so had he. "And so," he told her with the kitchen gone small and tight around them, "I killed Dave. "I killed him and buried him in the Mystic and now I've discovered, as if that crime weren't bad enough, that he was innocent. "These are the things I've done, Anna. And I can't undo them. I think I should go to jail. I should confess to Dave's murder and go back into jail, because I think I belong there. No, honey, I do. I'm not fit for out here. I can't be trusted." His voice sounded like someone else's. It sounded so far from the one he usually heard leaving his lips that he wondered if Annabeth saw a stranger before her, a carbon Jimmy, a Jimmy vanishing into the ether. Her face was dry and composed, though, so still she could have been posing for a painting. Chin tilted up, eyes clear and unreadable. Jimmy could hear the girls on the monitor again, whispering, the sound like a soft rustle of wind. Annabeth reached down and began unbuttoning his shirt, and Jimmy watched her deft fingers, his body numb. She opened the shirt and pushed it halfway off his shoulders and then she placed her cheek to it, her ear over the center of his chest. He said, "I just— " "Ssshh," she whispered. "I want to hear your heart." Her hands slid along his rib cage and then up his back, and she pressed the side of her head tighter against his chest. She closed her eyes, and a tiny smile curled up her lips. They sat that way for a while. The whispering on the monitor had changed to the hushed rumble of his daughters' sleeping.`,
