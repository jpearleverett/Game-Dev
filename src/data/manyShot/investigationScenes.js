  `See if any detectives would have picked up a kid for fighting on this street." "A kid." "Dave Boyle." "Oh, Jesus. His mother." "Let's hold off on that. Okay? Let's just see what the police say. Right?" Sean's mother went back inside. Sean looked at his father. He didn't seem to know where to put his hands. He put them in his pockets, then he pulled them out, wiped them on his pants. He said, "I'll be damned," very softly, and he looked down to the end of the street as if Dave hovered at the corner, a dancing mirage just beyond Sean's field of vision. "It was brown," Jimmy said. "What?" "The car. It was dark brown. Like a Plymouth, I think." "Anything else?" Sean tried to picture it, but he couldn't. He could see it only as something that had blocked his vision, not entered it. It had obscured Mrs. Ryan's orange Pinto and the lower half of her hedges, but Sean couldn't see the car itself. "It smelled like apples," he said. "What?" "Like apples. The car smelled like apples." "It smelled like apples," his father said. *** AN HOUR LATER, in Sean's kitchen, two other cops asked Sean and Jimmy a bunch of questions, and then a third guy showed up and drew sketches of the men in the brown car based on what Jimmy and Sean told them. The big blond cop looked meaner on the sketch pad, his face even bigger, but otherwise it was him. The second guy, the one who'd kept his eyes on the side-view, didn't look much like anything at all, a blur with black hair really, because Sean and Jimmy couldn't remember him too well. Jimmy's father showed up and stood in the corner of the kitchen looking mad and distracted, his eyes watery, weaving a bit as if the wall kept moving behind him.`,
  `"Jimmy?" "Here, Drew." "Sorry. It was Diane Cestra slept over. She's in there on the floor of Eve's bedroom, but no Katie." The flutter in Jimmy's chest stopped hard, as if it had been pinched between tweezers. "Hey, no problem." "Eve said Katie dropped them off round one? Didn't say where she was going." "Okay, man." Jimmy put a false brightness into his tone. "I'll track her down." "She seeing anyone maybe?" "Nineteen-year-old girls, Drew? Who could keep a tally?" "That's the cold truth," Drew said with a yawn. "Eve, Jimmy? All the calls she gets from different guys, I'd swear she needs a roster by the phone to keep 'em straight." Jimmy forced a chuckle. "Hey, thanks again, Drew." "Anytime, Jimmy. Take care." Jimmy hung up and looked down at the register keyboard as if it could tell him something. This wasn't the first time Katie had stayed out all night. Hell, it wasn't even the tenth. And it wasn't even the first time she'd blown off work, though in both cases, she usually called. Still, if she'd met a guy with movie-star looks and city-boy charm…Jimmy wasn't so far removed from nineteen himself that he couldn't remember what that was like. And while he'd never let Katie think he condoned it, he couldn't be so hypocritical in his heart as to condemn it. The bell hanging from a ribbon tacked to the top of the door clanged and Jimmy looked up to see the first group of coiffed blue-hairs from the rosary-bead crowd charge into the store, yapping away about the raw morning, the priest's diction, the litter in the streets. Pete stuck his head up from the deli counter and wiped his hands with the towel he'd been using to clean the prep table. He tossed a full box of surgical gloves up onto the counter and then came over behind the second cash register.`,
  `He relayed the information to Dispatch and Dispatch sent a unit out to Sydney Street. One of the patrolmen called back and requested more units, a Crime Scene tech or two, and, oh yeah, maybe you want to send a couple Homicides down or somebody like that. Just an idea. "Have you found a body, Thirty-three? Over." "Ah, negative, Dispatch." "Thirty-three, why the request for Homicide if there's no body? Over." "Looks of this car, Dispatch? I kinda feel like we're going to find one around here sooner or later." *** SEAN STARTED HIS first day back to work by parking on Crescent and walking around the blue sawhorses at the intersection with Sydney. The sawhorses were stamped with the label of the Boston Police Department, because they were first on-scene, but Sean guessed by what he'd heard on the scanners driving over here that this case would belong to State Police Homicide, his squad. The car, as he understood it, had been found on Sydney Street, which was city jurisdiction, but the blood trail led into Penitentiary Park, which as part of reservation land fell under State jurisdiction. Sean walked down Crescent along the edge of the park, and the first thing he noticed was a Crime Scene Services van parked halfway down the block. As he got closer, he saw his sergeant, Whitey Powers, standing a few feet away from a car with the driver's door ajar. Souza and Connolly, who'd been bumped up to Homicide only last week, searched the weeds outside the park entrance, coffee cups in hand, and two patrol units and the Crime Scene Services van were parked along the gravel shoulder, the CSS crew going over the car and shooting dirty looks at Souza and Connolly for trampling possible evidence and leaving the lids off their Styrofoam cups.`,
  `"That blood spatter fell on state land." "I dunno," the CSS tech said with a sigh. "We got an ADA en route," Whitey said. "He can call it. Till then, it's State." Sean took one look at the weeds leading up to the park and knew if they found a body, they'd find it in there. "What do we have?" The tech yawned. "Door was ajar when we found it. Keys were in the ignition, headlights were on. Like on cue, the battery shit the bed about ten seconds after we got on the scene." Sean noticed a bloodstain over the speaker on the driver's door. Some of it had dripped, black and crusty, over the speaker itself. He dropped to a squat and pivoted, saw another spot of black on top of the steering wheel. A third stain, longer and wider than the other two, clung to the edges of a bullet hole punched through the vinyl of the driver's seat back at shoulder level. Sean pivoted again so that he was looking past the door at the weeds to the left of the car, then he craned his head around to look at the outside of the driver's door, saw the fresh dent there. He looked up at Whitey, and Whitey nodded. "Perp probably stood outside the car. The Marcus girl— if that's who was driving— slams him with the door. Cocksucker gets a round off, hits her, ah, I dunno, in the shoulder, maybe the biceps? The girl makes a run for it anyway." He pointed at some weeds freshly flattened by running feet. "They trample the weeds heading for the park. Her wound couldn't have been too bad, because we've only found a few blood spatters in the weeds." Sean said, "We got units over in the park?" "Two so far." The CSS tech snorted.`,
  `"I think she ran for that ravine." Whitey's radio squawked and he put it to his lips. "Powers." "Sergeant, we need you over by the garden." "On my way." Sean watched Whitey trot onto the jogging path and then head for the garden co-op around the next bend, the hem of his son's hockey shirt flapping around his waist. Sean straightened from his squat and looked at the park, felt the sheer size of it, every bush, every knoll, all that water. He looked back at the small wooden bridge that led over a tiny ravine where the water was twice as dark and twice as polluted as the channel. Crusted with a permanent greasy film, it buzzed with mosquitoes in the summer. Sean noticed a spot of red in the thin, greening trees that sprouted along the bank of the ravine and he moved toward it, the CSS woman suddenly beside him, seeing it, too. "What's your name?" Sean said. "Karen," she said. "Karen Hughes." Sean shook her hand, the two of them focused on that spot of red as they crossed the joggers' path, not even hearing Whitey Powers until he was almost on top of them, trotting, short of breath. "We found a shoe," Whitey said. "Where?" Whitey pointed back down the joggers' path, past where it curved around the garden co-op. "In the garden. Woman's shoe. Size six." "Don't touch it," Karen Hughes said. "Duh," Whitey said, and got a look from her, Karen Hughes having one of those glacial looks that could shrink everything inside of you. "Excuse me. I meant— duh, ma'am." Sean turned back to the trees, and the spot of red was no longer a spot, it was a torn triangle of fabric, hanging from a thin branch about shoulder high. The three of them stood in front of it until Karen Hughes stepped back and snapped several photographs from four different angles, then dug in her bag for something.`,
  `On the stage below the screen, Krauser nodded once and Friel's head swiveled, looked around until he met Sean's eyes, and Sean knew this was his and Whitey's now. Sean saw a small amount of blood splattered on some leaves leading up to the base of the screen, saw some more on the steps leading up to the door. Connolly and Souza looked up from the blood on the stairs, gave Sean grim nods, and went back to peering at the crevices where the steps met the risers. Karen Hughes came up off her haunches and Sean could hear the whir of her camera as she flicked a knob with her thumb and the film spooled to the end. She reached into her bag for a fresh roll and flicked open the back of the camera, Sean noticing that her ash blond hair had darkened at the temples and bangs. She glanced at him without expression and dropped the spent film in her bag, then reloaded. Whitey was on his knees alongside the assistant ME, and Sean heard him say "What?" in a sharp whisper. "Just what I said." "You're sure now, yeah?" "Not a hundred percent, but I'm leaning." "Shit." Whitey looked back over his shoulder as Sean approached, and shook his head, jerked his thumb at the assistant ME. Sean's view widened as he climbed up behind them and their shoulders dropped away and he was looking down into the doorway, down at the body scrunched in there, the space between the walls no more than three feet wide and the corpse sitting with her back against the wall on his left, her feet pushed up hard against the wall on his right, so that Sean's first impression was of a fetus seen through a sonogram screen. Her left foot was bare and muddy.`,
  `What was left of the sock hung around her ankle, shriveled and torn. She wore a simple black shoe with a flat sole on her right foot, and it was caked in dried mud. Even after she'd lost the one shoe in the garden, she'd left the other one on. Her killer must have been breathing down her neck the whole way. And yet she'd come in here to hide. So for a moment she must have given him the slip, which meant something had slowed him down. "Souza," he called. "Yeah?" "Get some uniforms to check the trail leading up here. Look in the bushes and shit for torn clothes, scraped-off skin, anything like that." "We already got a guy doing casts on footprints." "Yeah, but we need more. You on it?" "I'm on it." Sean looked down at the body again. She wore soft, dark pants and a navy blue blouse with a wide neck. Her jacket was red and torn and Sean figured it for a weekend outfit, too nice for everyday for a girl from the Flats. She'd been out somewhere, somewhere nice, maybe on a date. And somehow she'd ended up stuffed in this narrow corridor, its mildewed walls the last thing she saw, probably the last thing she'd smelled. It was as if she'd gone in here to escape a red rain, and the downpour remained in her hair and cheeks, stained her clothing in wet strings. Her knees were pressed close to her chest, and her right elbow was propped on her right knee, a clenched fist up by her ear so that again Sean was reminded of a child more than a woman, curled up and trying to keep some awful sound at bay. Stop it, just stop it, the body said.`,
  `Stop it, please. Whitey moved out of the way, and Sean squatted just outside the doorway. Even with all the blood on the body and pooled beneath it and the mildew clinging to the concrete around it, Sean could smell her perfume, just a hint of it, slightly sweet, slightly sensual, the lightest scent, which made him think of high school dates and dark cars, the panicky fumbling through fabric and the electric grazing of flesh. Underneath the red rain, Sean could see several dark bruises on her wrist and forearm and ankles, and he knew these were the places where she'd been hit with something. "He beat her?" Sean said. "Looks that way. The blood from the top of her head? That's from a split on the crown. Guy probably broke whatever he was hitting her with, he brought it down so hard." Piled on the other side of her, filling this narrow corridor behind the screen, were wooden pallets and what looked like stage props— wooden schooners and cathedral tops, the bow of what looked like a Venetian gondola. She wouldn't have been able to move. Once she got in there, she was stuck. If whoever had been chasing her found her, then she'd die. And he'd found her. He'd opened the door on her, and she'd curled tight into herself, trying to protect her body with nothing more substantial than her own limbs. Sean craned his head and peered around her clenched fist, looked into her face. It, too, was streaked with red, and her eyes were clenched as tight as her fist, trying to wish it all away, the eyelids locked by fear at first and now by rigor. "That her?" Whitey Powers said. "Huh?" "Katherine Marcus," Whitey said. "That her?" "Yeah," Sean said. She had a small scar curving underneath the right side of her chin, barely noticeable and faded with time, but you'd notice it on Katie when you'd see her around the neighborhood because the rest of her was so unblemished, her face a flawless record of her mother's dark, angular beauty combined with her father's more tousled good looks, his pale eyes and hair.`,
  `Whitey walked backward, his hands raised and occasionally cutting left or right, his voice sniping the air with crisp whistles that shot through his lower teeth like puppy yelps. His eyes darted from the crime scene tape on either side of him to the van tires to the driver's nervous eyes in the side-view like he was auditioning for a job with a moving company, making sure those fat tires never strayed an inch or more from where he wanted them to go. "A little more. Keep it straight. Little more, little more. That's it." When he had the van where he wanted it, he stepped aside and slapped the rear doors. "You're good." Whitey opened the rear doors and pulled them wide so they blocked anyone's view of the space behind the screen, Sean thinking it never would have occurred to him to form protective wings around the doorway where Katie Marcus had died, and then reminding himself that Whitey had a lot more time put in on crime scenes than he had, Whitey an old warhorse going back to a time when Sean was still trying to cop feels at high school dances and not pick at his acne. The two coroner's assistants were both halfway out of their seats when Whitey called to them. "Ain't going to work that way, guys. You're gonna have to come out through the back." They shut their doors and disappeared through the back of the van to retrieve the corpse, and Sean could feel a finality in their disappearance, a certainty that this was his to deal with now. The other cops and teams of techs and the reporters hovering in their copters overhead or on the other side of the crime scene barriers that surrounded the park would move on to something else, and he and Whitey would bear the lion's share of Katie Marcus's death alone, filing the reports, preparing the affidavits, working her death long after most of the people here had moved on to something else— traffic accidents, larcenies, suicides in rooms gone stale with recirculated air and overflowing ashtrays.`,
  `"Excuse me, dear?" Whitey repeated himself, leaning in. "No," Mrs. Prior said. "It was more like a car hitting a rock or a curb. And then it stalled and then someone said, 'Hi.'" "Someone said, 'Hi'?" "Hi." Mrs. Prior looked at Sean and nodded. "And then part of the car cracked." Sean and Whitey looked at each other. Whitey said, "Cracked?" Mrs. Prior nodded her little blue head. "When my Leo was alive, he snapped the axle on our Plymouth? It made such a noise! Crack!" Her eyes grew bright. "Crack!" she said. "Crack!" "And that's what you heard after someone said, 'Hi.'" She nodded. "Hi and crack!" "And then you looked out your window and saw what?" "Oh, no, no," Mrs. Prior said. "I didn't look out my window. I was in my dressing gown by then. I'd been in bed. I wasn't looking out the window in my dressing gown. People could see." "But fifteen minutes before, you'd— " "Young man, I wasn't in my dressing gown fifteen minutes before. I'd just finished watching TV, a wonderful film with Glenn Ford. Oh, I wish I could remember the name." "So you turned off the TV…" "And I saw those motherless children in the street, and then I went upstairs and changed into my dressing gown, and then, young sir, I kept my shades drawn." "The voice that said, 'Hi,'" Whitey said. "Was it male or female?" "Female, I think," Mrs. Prior said. "It was a high voice. Not like either of yours," she said brightly. "You two have fine masculine voices. Your mothers must be proud." Whitey said, "Oh, yes, ma'am. Like you wouldn't believe." As they left the house, Sean said, "Crack!" Whitey smiled. "She liked saying that, you know? Got some blood pumping in the old girl." "You thinking snapped axle or gunshot?" "Gunshot," Whitey said.`,
  `"The keys hit the clock, I'm thinking, 'I'm glad those girls aren't here. They don't need to see that shit.'" In the car, Whitey said, "You work up a timeline yet?" Sean nodded, flipped through his notes. "They leave Curley's Folly at nine-thirty, do the Banshee, Dick Doyle's Pub, and Spire's in quick succession, end up at McGills around eleven-thirty, are inside the Last Drop at ten past one." "And she's crashing her car about half an hour later." Sean nodded. "You see any familiar names on the bartender's list?" Sean looked down at the list of Saturday night patrons the bartender at McGills had scribbled on a sheet of paper. "Dave Boyle," he said aloud when he got to it. "The same guy you were friends with as a kid?" "Could be," Sean said. "He might be a guy to talk to," Whitey said. "He thinks you're a friend, he won't treat us like cops, clam up for no good reason." "Sure." "We'll put him on tomorrow's to-do list." *** THEY FOUND ROMAN FALLOW sipping a latte at Café Society in the Point. He sat with a woman who looked like a model— kneecaps as sharp as her cheekbones, eyes bulging slightly because the skin on her face was pulled so tight it looked like it had been glued to the bone, nice off-white summer dress with those spaghetti straps that made her look sexy and skeletal at the same time, Sean wondering how she pulled that off and deciding it must be the pearl glow of her perfect skin. Roman wore a silk T-shirt tucked into pleated linen trousers, looking like he just stepped off a soundstage of one of those old RKO movies set in Havana or Key West. He sipped his latte and leafed through the paper with his girl, Roman reading the business section, his model thumbing through the style section.`,
  `"Yeah, but that kid?" He wandered back toward a rear bedroom. Sean stepped into the hall. "I don't like him for it, either, but we gotta be sure." "Well, the father, too, and her crazy fucking uncles, but I already got guys talking to the neighbors. I don't see it playing that way, either." Sean leaned against the wall, sipped from his Coke. "If this was random, Sarge, I mean, shit…" "Yeah, tell me about it." Whitey turned into the hallway, a fresh shirt over his shoulders. "The old lady, Prior," he said as he started buttoning, "she didn't hear a scream." "Heard a gunshot." "We say it was a gunshot. But, yeah, we're probably right. But she didn't hear a scream." "Maybe the Marcus girl was too busy hitting the guy with her door and trying to run away." "I'll give you that. But when she first saw him? He's coming toward her car?" Whitey passed Sean and turned into the kitchen. Sean came off the wall and followed him. "Which means she probably knew him. That's why she said hi." "Yeah." Whitey nodded. "And why else would she stop the car in the first place?" "No," Sean said. "No?" Whitey leaned against the counter, looked at Sean. "No," Sean repeated. "That car was crashed, wheels turned into the curb." "No skid marks, though." Sean nodded. "She's driving maybe fifteen miles an hour and something causes her to swerve into the curb." "What?" "Fuck do I know? You're the boss." Whitey smiled and drained his Coke in one long swallow. He opened the fridge for another. "What makes someone swerve without hitting the brakes?" "Something in the road," Sean said. Whitey lifted his fresh Coke in acknowledgment. "But there was nothing in the road by the time we got there." "That was the next morning." "So a brick, something like that?" "Brick's too small, don't you think?`,
  `That time a night?" "A cinder block." "Okay." "Something, though," Whitey said. "Something," Sean agreed. "She swerves, hits the curb, her foot comes off the clutch, and the car kicks out." "At which point, the perp appears." "Who she knows. And then, what, he just walks up and caps her?" "And she hits him with the door, and— " "You ever been hit with a car door?" Whitey lifted his collar and slid his tie around it, started working on the knot. "Missed out on the experience so far." "It's like a punch. If you're standing real close, and a woman weighs oneten pushes a shitty little Toyota door into you, it ain't going to do much but annoy you. Karen Hughes said the shooter was maybe six inches away when he fired his first round. Six inches." Sean could see his point. "Okay. But maybe she falls back and kicks the door. That would do the job." "Door's gotta be open, though. She can kick it all day if it's still closed and it ain't going to go nowhere. She had to open it, by hand, and shove off with her arm. So either the killer stepped back and caught the door when he wasn't expecting it, or…" "He doesn't weigh much." Whitey closed his collar back over the tie. "Which brings me back to the footprints." "The fucking footprints," Sean said. "Yes!" Whitey yelled. "The fucking footprints." He closed his top button, slid the knot up to his throat. "Sean, the doer's chasing this woman through a park. She's running full-out, he's gotta be charging after her like a raped ape. I mean, he's booking through that park. You telling me he's not going to dig in at least once?" "It rained all night." "But we found three of hers.`,
  `"We are going on the assumption that she knew her killer. Correct?" Sean and Whitey looked at each other, then back at the head of the table, and nodded. "So, not that East Bucky doesn't have its share of crack addicts, particularly in the Flats, but would a girl like Katherine Marcus have associated with them?" "Another good point." Whitey sighed. "Yeah." Friel said, "I wish for everyone's sake this was a hit. But the bludgeoning? That says rage to me. That says lack of control." Whitey nodded. "But we can't rule it out entirely. All I'm saying." "Agreed, Sergeant." Friel looked back at Souza, who seemed a bit pissed by the digression. He cleared his throat and took his time looking back at his notes. "Anyway, we talked to this one guy— a Thomas Moldanado— who was drinking at the Last Drop, the last bar where Katherine Marcus went before she dropped off her friends. Seems they got one toilet in the whole place, and Moldanado said there was a line for it just as he noticed the three girls leaving. So he goes out back into the parking lot to take a piss, and he saw a guy sitting in a car, lights off. Moldanado said this was at one-thirty, on the dot. Said his watch was new and he checked to see if it glowed in the dark." "Did it?" "Apparently." "The guy in the car, though," Robert Burke said, "could've been sleeping off a drunk." "First point we made, Sergeant. Moldanado said that's what he thought at first, too, but, no, the guy was sitting upright, eyes open. Moldanado said he would have taken him for a cop, but the guy drove a small foreign car, like a Honda or a Subaru." "A little banged up," Connolly said.`,
  `"Dent in the front passenger quarter." "Right," Souza said. "So then Moldanado figured he was a john. Said that area's popular at night for hookers. But if that was the case, what was the guy doing in a parking lot? Why not just cruise the avenue?" Whitey said, "Okay, so— " Souza held up a hand. "One sec, Sarge." He looked over at Connolly, his eyes bright and jumpy. "We took another look around the parking lot, and we found blood." "Blood." He nodded. "If you walked past it, you'd figure it for some guy was changing his oil in the lot. It was that thick, all pooled in mostly one place. We start looking around, we find a drop here, a drop there, all moving away from the spot. Find a few more drops on the walls and the floor of the alley behind the bar." "Trooper," Friel said, "what the fuck are you telling us?" "Someone else got hurt outside the Last Drop that night." "How do you know it was the same night?" Whitey said. "CSS confirmed. A night watchman parked his car in the lot that night, covered the blood, but also kept it from most of the heavy rain. Look, whoever the vic was, he's hurt bad. And the guy who attacked him? He's hurt, too. We found two types of blood in the lot. We're checking hospitals now, and cab companies, in case the victim hopped a ride. We found bloody hair fibers, skin, and some skull tissue. We're waiting on callbacks from six ERs. The rest have turned out negative, but I'm still betting we find a victim who walked into an ER somewhere with blunt head trauma on Saturday night, early Sunday morning." Sean held up a hand. "The same night Katherine Marcus walks out of the Last Drop, you're telling us someone caved in someone's skull in the parking lot of the same bar?" Souza smiled.`,
  `"Yup." Connolly picked up the ball. "CSS found dried blood, types A and B neg. A lot more A than B neg, so we figure the victim was A." "Katherine Marcus's blood was type O," Whitey said. Connolly nodded. "Hair fibers indicate the victim was male." Friel said, "What's the operating theory here?" "We don't have one. We just know that on the night Katherine Marcus was killed, someone else got his head handed to him in the parking lot of the last bar she went to." Maggie Mason said, "There was a bar fight in the parking lot. So what?" "None of the patrons at the bar remember any fights— in or out of the place. Between one-thirty and one-fifty, the only people to leave the bar were Katherine Marcus, her two friends, and this witness, Moldanado, who went right back in when his piss was finished. No one else entered. Moldanado sees someone staking out the parking lot at approximately onethirty, guy he describes as 'regular-looking,' maybe mid-thirties, dark hair. Guy was gone when Moldanado exited the bar at one-fifty." "At which point the Marcus girl was running through Pen Park." Souza nodded. "We're not saying there's a clear connection. Maybe there's none at all. But it seems pretty coincidental." "But again," Friel said, "what's your operating theory?" Souza shrugged. "I don't know, sir. Let's say it was a hit. The guy in the parking lot, he's watching for the Marcus girl to leave. She does, he makes a phone call to the perp. The perp's waiting for her from that point on." "And then what?" Sean said. "Then what? He kills her." "No, the guy in the car. The lookout. What's he doing? He just up and decides to beat some guy with a rock or something?`,
  `The father didn't like either O'Donnell or the Harris kid." "Why not the Harris kid?" "We don't know." Whitey glanced over at Sean and then back again. "We're working on it, though. So, best we can figure, she's planning to boogie on out of town in the morning. She has a pseudo-bachelorette party with her two friends, gets run out of a bar by Roman Fallow, and drives her friends home. It's starting to rain now and her wipers are for shit, the windshield dirty. She either misjudges where the curb is because she's drunk, nods off for a second at the wheel for the same reason, or swerves to avoid something in the road. Whatever the cause, she drives her car into the curb. Car stalls and someone approaches the car. According to our old lady witness, Katherine Marcus says, 'Hi.' That's when we think the perp fired his first shot. She manages to hit him with her car door— maybe his gun did jam, I dunno— and she takes off running into the park. She grew up there, maybe she thought she had a better chance of losing him there. Again, we can't even surmise why she chose to run for the park, except for it being a straight run in either direction on Sydney and not a lot in the way of neighbors to help her out for at least four blocks. If she'd stepped out into the open, the perp could have run her down with her own car or shot her pretty easily. So, she bolts for the park. She goes in a pretty consistent southeast pattern from that point on, cutting through the garden co-op, then attempting to hide in the ravine under the footbridge, then making a final beeline for the drive-in screen.`,
  `The timing chain on my Accord went at sixty-five thousand on the nose. I find out the same thing happened to another buddy of mine. What it costs to fix ain't much less than the Blue Book, damn near totals the car. You know?" Dave said, "Nope. Mine's been a dream." He looked over his shoulder, then back at them. "I'm going to go get those smokes. See you guys inside?" "See you there," Sean said, and gave Dave a small wave before Dave stepped off the curb and crossed the avenue. Whitey looked at the Honda. "Nice dent over the front quarter panel there." Sean said, "Gee, Sarge, wasn't sure you'd noticed." "And the pool stick story?" Whitey whistled. "What— he's holding the butt of the stick against his palm?" "Got a problem, though," Sean said as they watched Dave enter Eagle Liquors. "Yeah, what's that, Supercop?" "If you make Dave for the guy Souza's witness saw in the parking lot of the Last Drop, then he was kicking someone else's head in when Katie Marcus was killed." Whitey gave him a disappointed grimace. "You think so? I make him for a guy sitting in a parking lot when a girl who would die half an hour later left the bar. I make him for someone who wasn't home at one-fifteen like he said." Through the glass storefront, they could see Dave at the counter, talking to the clerk. Whitey said, "The blood CSS scraped off the ground in the parking lot could have been there for days. We got no proof anything ever happened there but a bar fight. Guys in the bar say it didn't happen that night? It could have happened the day before. It could have happened that afternoon. There's no causal connection between the blood in that parking lot and Dave Boyle sitting in his car at one-thirty.`,
  `He wanted to bang his head against the wall behind him and knock the images right the fuck out. "No. I think she knows when he came home. And now that she overheard us, she knows he was at the Last Drop that night. So, maybe, she had all these things in her head about that night that didn't jibe, and now she's putting all the pieces together." "And those pieces are scaring the shit out of her?" "Maybe. I dunno." Sean kicked at a piece of loose stone at the base of a building. "I feel like…" "What?" "I feel like we got all these parts banging around near each other, but they don't fit. I feel like we're missing something." "You really don't think Boyle did it?" "I'm not ruling him out. I'm not. I'd buy him for it, if for one second I could imagine a motive." Whitey stepped back and lifted his heel, rested it against the light pole. He looked at Sean the way Sean had seen him look at a witness he wasn't sure would hold up in court. "Okay," he said, "lack of motive's bothering me, too. But not much, Sean. Not much. I think there's something out there that could tie him to this. Otherwise, why the fuck's he lying to us?" "Come on," Sean said. "That's the job. People lie to us for no other reason but to see what it feels like. That block surrounding the Last Drop? There's some serious street trade there at night— you got regular hookers, transvestites, friggin' kids all working that circuit. Maybe Dave was just getting a hummer in his car, doesn't want the wife to find out. Maybe he has a lady on the side. Who knows? But nothing, so far, connects him to within a mile of murdering Katherine Marcus." "Nothing but a bunch of his lies and my feeling the guy's dirty." "Your feeling," Sean said.`,
  `These things happen, you know?" Sean had woken up this morning from a dream in which he'd held his daughter and spoken her name, even though he didn't know it and couldn't remember what he'd said in the dream, so he was still a little foggy. "We found blood," Whitey said. "Where?" "The front seat of Boyle's car." "How much?" Whitey held his thumb and index finger a hair's width apart. "A bit. Found some more in the trunk." "In the trunk," Sean said. "A lot more actually." "So?" "So, it's at the lab." "No," Sean said. "I meant so what if you found blood in the trunk? Katie Marcus never got in anyone's trunk." "That's a fly in the ointment, sure." "Sarge, your search of the car's going to be tossed out." "No." "No?" "The car was stolen and abandoned in State jurisdiction. Purely for insurance purposes and, I might add, in the best interest of the owner— " "You did a physical search and filed a report." "Ah, you're quick, boy." They pulled up in front of Dave Boyle's house and Whitey raised the gearshift on the driver's column into park. He killed the engine. "I got enough to bring him in for a chat. That's all I want right now." Sean nodded, knowing there was no point in arguing with the man. Whitey got to be a sergeant in the Homicide Unit by the dog-to-a-bone tenacity he had regarding his hunches. You didn't talk him out of his hunches, you rode them out. "What about the ballistics?" Sean said. "That's a weird one, too," Whitey said as they sat looking at Dave's house, Whitey making no move to leave just yet. "The gun was a thirtyeight Smith like we figured. Part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer in New Hampshire in 'eighty-one.`,
  `The same gun that killed Katherine Marcus was involved in a liquor store holdup in 'eighty-two. Right here in Buckingham." "The Flats?" Whitey shook his head. "Up in Rome Basin, place called Looney Liquors. It was a two-man job, both guys wearing rubber masks. They came in through the back after the owner had shut the front doors, and the first guy into the store fired a warning shot that went through a bottle of rye and embedded in the wall. Rest of the robbery went smooth-'n'-styling, but the bullet was recovered. Ballistics matched it to the same gun as the one killed the Marcus girl." "So that would tend to point in another direction, don't you think?" Sean said. "Nineteen-eighty-two, Dave was, like, seventeen and starting out at Raytheon. I don't think he was pulling any liquor store jobs." "Don't mean the gun didn't eventually end up in his hands. Shit, kid, you know the way they get passed around." Whitey didn't sound as sure of himself as he had last night, but he said, "Let's go get him," and pushed open his door. Sean got out of the passenger side and they walked up to Dave's place, Whitey thumbing the cuffs on his hip like he was hoping he'd get an excuse to use them. *** JIMMY PARKED his car and carried a cardboard tray of coffee cups and a bag of doughnuts across the cracked tar parking lot toward the Mystic River. The cars slammed across the metal extension spans of the Tobin Bridge above him, and Katie knelt by the water's edge with Just Ray Harris, both of them peering into the river. Dave Boyle was there, too, his bruised hand ballooned to the size of a boxing glove. Dave sat in a sagging lawn chair beside Celeste and Annabeth.`,
  `And it wasn't like that was common knowledge, so it was either Marvin who told 'em, or one of them two used to work here." "And you told the police that at the time?" "Oh, sure." The old guy waved his hand at the memory. "They went through my old records, questioned everyone who used to work for me. So they said, anyway. They never arrested no one. You say the same gun was used in another crime?" "Yeah," Sean said. "Mr. Looney— " "Lowell, for Christ's sake, please." "Lowell," Sean said, "you still got those employment records?" *** DAVE STARED at the mirrored glass in the interrogation room knowing that Sean's partner, and maybe Sean, too, stared back at him. Good. How's it going? I'm enjoying this Sprite myself. What's it they put in the stuff? Limon. That's right. I'm enjoying my limon, Sergeant. Mmm-mmm good. Yes siree. Can't wait to get me another can of this. Dave stared straight into the center of the mirror from the other side of the long table and he felt great. True, he didn't know where Celeste had gone with Michael, and a dread came with the ignorance that polluted his brain far more than the fifteen or so beers he'd downed last night. But she'd come back. He seemed to remember he might have scared her last night. He definitely hadn't made much sense, going on about vampires and things that went in you not being able to come back out, so maybe she'd gotten a little spooked. Couldn't say he blamed her. It was really his fault allowing the Boy to take over like that and show his ugly, feral face. But outside of Celeste and Michael being gone, he felt strong. He felt none of the indecision he'd felt over the last few days.`,
  `He let loose a shudder of a yawn, and brought his head and hands back down. "Whitey," he said, trying to hold back as long as possible on the question he'd known he'd have to ask all morning. "What's up?" "Anything in your file on known associates?" Whitey lifted the file off the desk and flipped it open, turned the first few pages over. "'Known criminal associates,'" he read, "'Reginald (aka Reggie Duke) Neil, Patrick Moraghan, Kevin "Whackjob" Sirracci, Nicholas Savage'— hmm— 'Anthony Waxman…'" He looked up at Sean, and Sean knew it was there. "'James Marcus,'" Whitey said, "'aka "Jimmy Flats," reputed leader of a criminal crew sometimes called the Rester Street Boys.'" Whitey closed the file. Sean said, "And the hits just keep on coming, don't they?" *** THE HEADSTONE Jimmy picked was simple and white. The salesman spoke in a low, respectful voice, as if he'd rather be anyplace but here, and yet he kept trying to nudge Jimmy toward more expensive stones, ones with angels and cherubs or roses engraved in the marble. "Maybe a Celtic cross," the salesman said, "a choice that's quite popular with…" Jimmy waited for him to say "your people," but the salesman caught himself and finished with "…an awful lot of people these days." Jimmy would have forked over the money for a mausoleum if he thought it would make Katie happy, but he knew his daughter had never been a fan of ostentation or overadornment. She'd worn simple clothes and simple jewelry, no gold, and she'd rarely used makeup unless it was a special occasion. Katie had liked things clean, with just a subtle hint of style, and that's why Jimmy chose the white and ordered the engraving in the calligraphic script, the salesman warning him that the latter choice would double the engraver's cost, and Jimmy turning his head to look down at the little vulture, backing him up a few feet as he said, "Cash or check?" Jimmy had asked Val to drive him over, and when he left the office, he got back in the passenger seat of Val's Mitsubishi 3000 GT, Jimmy wondering for probably the tenth time how a guy in his mid-thirties could drive a car like this and not think he looked anything but silly.`,
  `"Grew up in the Basin, paints houses. Anyway, he claims he saw someone staking out the parking lot of the Last Drop just before Katie left. He said the guy definitely wasn't no cop. Drove a foreign car with a dented front quarter, passenger side." "Okay." "Other weird thing was, I talk to Sandy Greene. 'Member her from the Looey?" Jimmy could see her sitting in the classroom, brown pigtails, crooked teeth, always chewed her pencils until they snapped in her mouth and she had to spit out the lead. "Yeah. What's she doing these days?" "Hooking," Val said. "And she looks rough, man. Our age, right? And my mother looked better in her coffin. Anyway, she's like the oldest pro out there on that circuit near the Last Drop. She says she sort of adopted this kid. Runaway kid, works the trade." "Kid?" "Like eleven-, twelve-year-old boy." "Ah, Jesus." "Hey, that's life. Anyway, this kid, she thinks his real name is Vincent. Everyone called him 'Little Vince' except Sandy. She said he preferred 'Vincent.' And Vincent's a lot older than twelve, you know? Vincent's a pro. She says he'll fuck you up you try anything with him, keeps a razor blade tucked under his Swatch band, that sorta thing. There six nights a week. Until this Saturday, that is." "What happened to him on Saturday?" "No one knows. But he vanished. Sandy said he sometimes crashed at her place. She gets back there Sunday morning and his shit is gone. He blew town." "So, he blew town. Good for him. Maybe he got out of the life." "That's what I said. Sandy said, No, this kid was into it. She said he was going to make one very scary adult, you know? But for now, he's a kid, and he dug the work.`,
  `She said if he blew town, only one thing could have caused it and that was fear. Sandy thinks he saw something, something that terrified him, and she said that something would have to be pretty bad, because little Vince don't scare easy." "You got feelers out?" "Yeah. It's hard, though. The kiddie trade ain't, like, organized. You know? They're just living on the street, picking up a couple of bucks however they can, blowing town whenever they feel like it. But I got people looking. We find this Vincent kid, I figure maybe he knows something about the guy sitting in the parking lot of the Last Drop, maybe he saw the, you know, Katie's death." "If it had anything to do with this guy in the car." "Moldanado said the guy gave off a bad vibe. Something about him, he said, even though it was dark, he couldn't see the guy good, he just said a vibe came from that car." A vibe, Jimmy thought. Oh, yeah, that's helpful. "And this was just before Katie left?" "Just before, yeah. The police, right, they sealed off the parking lot Monday morning, had a whole team down there, scraping the asphalt." Jimmy nodded. "So something went down in that parking lot." "Yeah. That's what I don't get. Katie was taken off on Sydney, man. That's like ten blocks away." Jimmy drained his coffee cup. "What if she went back?" "Huh?" "To the Last Drop. I know what the prevailing theory is— she dropped Eve and Diane, drove up Sydney, and that's when it happened. But what if she drove back to the Last Drop first? She drove back, she runs into the guy. He abducts her, forces her to drive back to Pen Park, and then it goes down like the cops think?" Val tossed his empty coffee cup back and forth between his hands.`,
  `"Yeah. Trucker went to take a piss, didn't know he was staked out. The Harris guy jacked the truck and drove away, but the trucker called in, put it on the wire right away, we pulled the thing over in Needham." "But Harris walked," Sean said. Burden looked up at him for the first time, Sean seeing the fear and selfhatred in those milky eyes and hoping he never caught what Burden had. "He didn't walk," Burden said. "He rolled. He rolled on the guy who'd hired him for the trucking job, guy name a Stillson, I think. Yeah, Meyer Stillson." Sean had heard about Burden's memory— supposedly photographic— but to see the guy reach back eighteen years and pluck names out of the fog like he'd been talking about them yesterday was humbling and depressing at the same time. Guy could have run the whole show, for Christ's sake. "So he rolled and that was it?" Whitey said. Burden frowned. "Harris had a record. He wasn't walking just because he gave us his boss's name. No, BPD's Anti-Gang Unit stepped in to get info on another case, and he rolled again." "On who?" "Guy ran the Rester Street Boys, Jimmy Marcus." Whitey looked over at Sean, one eyebrow cocked. "This was after the counting room robbery, right?" Sean said. "What counting room robbery?" Whitey asked. "It's what Jimmy did time for," Sean said. Burden nodded. "Him and another guy took off the MBTA counting room on a Friday night. In and out in two minutes. They knew what time the guards changed shifts. They knew exactly when they bagged up the cash. They had two guys out on the street who stalled the Brinks truck as it came to make the pickup. They were slick as hell and they knew too much not to have had a guy on the inside, or at least someone who'd worked for the T at some point in the previous year or two." "Ray Harris," Whitey said.`,
  `"Yup. He gave us Stillson and he gave the BPD the Rester Street Boys." "All of 'em?" Burden shook his head. "No, just Marcus, but he was the brains. Cut off the head, the body dies, you know? BPD picked him up coming out of a storage warehouse the morning of the Saint Pat's parade. That was the day they planned to split up the take, so Marcus had a suitcase full of money in his hand." "But wait," Sean said, "did Ray Harris testify in open court?" "No. Marcus cut a deal long before it went to court. He dummied up on who he'd been working with and he took the fall. All the shit everyone knew he'd been behind they couldn't prove. Kid was like nineteen or something. Twenty? He'd been running that crew since he was seventeen and he'd never even been arrested. DA cut the deal for two inside, three suspended, because he knew there was a good chance they wouldn't even be able to convict in open court. Heard the Anti-Gang guys were pissed, but whatta you going to do?" "So Jimmy Marcus never knew Ray Harris ratted him out?" Burden looked up from the calendar again, fixed his swimming eyes on Sean with a vague contempt. "In a three-year span, Marcus pulled off something like sixteen major heists. Once, right, he hit twelve different jewelers in the Jeweler's Exchange building on Washington Street. Even now, no one knows how the fuck he did it. He had to circumvent close to twenty different alarms— alarms running off phone lines, satellites, cellular, which was a completely new technology back then. He was eighteen. You believe that shit? Eighteen years old and he's breaking alarm codes that pros in their forties couldn't crack. The Keldar Technics job?`,
  `He and his guys went in through the roof, jammed the fire department frequencies, and then they set off the sprinkler system. Best anyone could figure at the time, they were hanging suspended up at the ceiling until the sprinkler system shorted out the motion detectors. The guy was a fucking genius. If he went to work for NASA instead of himself? We'd be taking the wife and kids on vacation to Pluto. You think a guy this smart wouldn't have figured out who fingered him? Ray Harris vanished from the face of the earth two months after Marcus rotated back into the free world. What does that tell you?" Sean said, "It tells me you think Jimmy Marcus murdered Ray Harris." "Or he had that midget prick, Val Savage, do it. Look, call Ed Folan at the D-7. He's a captain there now, but he used to work the Anti-Gang Unit. He can tell you all about Marcus and Ray Harris. Every cop who worked East Bucky in the eighties will tell you the same thing. If Jimmy Marcus didn't kill Ray Harris, I'm the next Jewish pope." He pushed the calendar away with his finger and stood up, hitched his pants. "I gotta go eat. You take her easy, fellas." He walked back through the squad room, his head swiveling as he took it all in, maybe the desk he used to sit at, the board where his cases used to be listed beside everyone else's, the person he had been in this room before that person went AWOL, ended up in the property room praying for the day when he could punch that clock for the last time, go someplace where no one remembered who he could have been. Whitey turned to Sean. "Pope Marshall the Lost?" *** THE LONGER HE SAT in the rickety chair in that cold room, the more Dave realized that what he'd thought was a hangover this morning had merely been the continuation of last night's drunk.`,
  `He looked about as much like Dave Boyle as Whitey did. He turned face-front and stepped up to the glass, and Moldanado said, "Yeah, yeah. That's the guy I saw." "You sure?" "Ninety-five percent," he said. "It was night, you know? There are no lights in that parking lot and, hey, I was buzzed. But otherwise I'm almost positive that's the guy I saw." "You didn't mention a beard in your statement," Sean said. "No, but I think now that, yeah, the guy had a beard maybe." Whitey said, "No one else in that lineup looks like the guy?" "Shit, no," he said. "They ain't even close. What're they— cops?" Whitey lowered his head to the dais and whispered, "Why do I even do this fucking job?" Moldanado looked at Sean. "What? What?" Sean opened the door behind him. "Thanks for coming down, Mr. Moldanado. We'll be in touch." "I did good, though, right? I mean, I helped." "Sure," Whitey said. "We'll FedEx that merit badge to you." Sean gave Moldanado a smile and a nod and shut the door on him as soon as he crossed the threshold. "No witness," Sean said. "Uh, no shit." "The physical evidence from the car won't hold up in court." "I'm aware of that." Sean watched Dave put a hand over his eyes and squint into the light. He looked like he hadn't slept in a month. "Sarge. Come on." Whitey turned from the microphone and looked at him. He was starting to look exhausted, too, the whites of his eyes gone pink. "Fuck it," he said. "Kick him loose." 24 A BANISHED TRIBE CELESTE SAT by the window of Nate &amp; Nancy's Coffee Shop on Buckingham Avenue across from Jimmy Marcus's house as Jimmy and Val Savage parked Val's car half a block up and started walking back down toward the house.`,
  `"He sends money?" Brendan nodded. "Once a month like clockwork." "From where?" "Huh?" "The envelopes the money comes in. Where are they sent from?" "New York." "Always?" "Yeah." "Is it cash?" "Yeah. Five hundred a month mostly. More at Christmas." Sean said, "Does he ever write a note?" "No." "So how do you know it's him?" "Who else would send us money every month? He's guilty. My ma says he was always that way— he'd do shitty things, think that just because he felt bad about them it absolved him. You know?" Sean said, "I want to see one of the envelopes the money came in." "My mother throws 'em away." Sean said, "Shit," and swiveled the computer screen out of his line of vision. Everything about the case was bugging him— Dave Boyle as a suspect, Jimmy Marcus's being the father of the victim, the victim herself having been killed with her boyfriend's father's gun. And then he thought of something else that bugged him, though not in any way pertinent to the case. "Brendan," he said, "if your father abandoned the family while your mother was pregnant, why'd she name the baby after him?" Brendan's gaze drifted off into the squad room. "My mom ain't entirely there. You know? She tries and all, but…" "Okay…" "She says she named him Ray to remind herself." "Of what?" "Men." He shrugged. "How if you give 'em half a chance, they'll fuck you over just to prove they can." "But when your brother turned out mute, how'd that make her feel?" "Pissed," Brendan said, and a tiny smile played on his lips. "Kinda proved her point, though. Least in her mind." He touched the paperclip tray on the edge of Sean's desk, and the tiny smile vanished. "Why you asking me if my father had a gun?" Sean was suddenly tired of games and being polite and cautious.`,
  `You know what that adds up to over the years? Almost eighty grand. Who's going to send that if it ain't the father?" Whitey dabbed his lips with a napkin and then dove back into his cheeseburger, Sean wondering how the guy had managed to dodge a heart attack so far, eating and drinking the way he did, pulling seventy-hour weeks when a case sank its teeth into him. "Let's say he is alive," Whitey said. "Let's." "What's this, then— some grand mastermind plot to get back at Jimmy Marcus for something by wasting his daughter? What, we're starring in a movie now?" Sean chuckled. "Who would play you, you think?" Whitey sucked his soda through a straw until it slurped against the ice. "I think about that a lot, you know. It could happen, we bust this case, Supercop. Phantom from New York kinda shit? You know we'd be up there on the big screen. And Brian Dennehy would be all over the chance to play me." Sean considered him. "That's not entirely insane," he said, wondering how he'd never seen it before. "You're not as tall, Sarge, but you got the gut." Whitey nodded and pushed his plate away. "I'm thinking one of those Friends pussies could play you. You know, guys look like they spend an hour every morning clipping their nose hair and plucking their eyebrows, get pedicures once a week? Yeah, one of them would do just fine." "Jealous." "That's the thing, though," Whitey said. "This Ray Harris angle is such a curve. It's got a probability quotient of, like, six." "Out of ten?" "Out of a thousand. Backtrack, okay? Ray Harris rats out Jimmy Marcus. Marcus finds out, gets out of the stir, puts a hit on Ray. Harris, what, he gets away somehow, goes to New York, finds a steady enough job to send five bills home each and every month for the next thirteen years?`,
  `Then one day he wakes up and goes, 'Okay. Payback time,' and gets on a bus, comes here, and smokes Katherine Marcus. And not just in the regular everyday kinda way, but he smokes her with extreme prejudice. That was psycho rage in that park. And then, old Ray— and I do mean old, he's gotta be forty-five, humping through that park after her— he just gets on a bus and goes back to New York with his gun? Did you check New York?" Sean nodded. "No matches on the social, no credit cards in his name, no employment history for a guy with his name and age. NYPD and State have never arrested anyone matching his prints." "But you think he killed Katherine Marcus." Sean shook his head. "No. I mean, not for sure. I don't even know if he's alive. I'm just saying I think he could be. And it's real likely that the murder weapon was his gun. And I think Brendan knows something, and he definitely has no one who can confirm that he was home in bed when Katie Marcus was murdered. So I'm hoping he spends enough time in that cell, he'll tell us a few things." Whitey let out a burp that ripped the air. "You're a prince, Sarge." Whitey shrugged. "We don't even know that Ray Harris held up that liquor store eighteen years ago. We don't know if that was his gun. It's all conjecture. It's circumstantial at best. Never hold up in court. Hell, a good ADA wouldn't even present it." "Yeah, but it feels right." "Feels." He looked over Sean's shoulder as the door behind Sean opened. "Oh, Jesus, the moron twins." Souza came around the side of their booth with Connolly a few steps behind. "And you said it was nothing, Sarge." Whitey put a hand behind his ear, looked up at Souza.`,
  `"What's that, boy? My hearing, you know?" "We ran the tow records from the parking lot of the Last Drop," Souza said. "That's BPD jurisdiction," Whitey said. "What I tell you about that?" "We found a car ain't been claimed yet, Sarge." "And?" "We had the attendant go out to double-check it was still there. He came back on the phone, said the trunk's leaking." "Leaking what?" Sean said. "Don't know, but he said it smelled awful ripe." *** THE CADILLAC WAS two-toned, a white hardtop over a midnight blue body. Whitey bent by the passenger window, his hands on either side of his eyes. "I'd say that's a suspicious-looking brown smear by the driver's door console." Connolly, standing by the trunk, said, "Jesus, you smell this shit? It's reeking like friggin' low tide at Wollaston." Whitey came around the back just as the tow lot attendant put the lockpuncher into Sean's hand. Sean stepped up beside Connolly, moving the man out of the way as he said, "Use your tie." "What?" "Over your mouth and nose, man. Use your tie." "What are you using?" Whitey pointed at his own shiny upper lip. "We put Vicks on during the ride over. Sorry, boys, all out." Sean positioned the rim at the end of the lock-punch. He slipped it over the Cadillac's trunk lock and drove it home, felt the metal slide over metal and then catch, grip the entire lock cylinder. "We in?" Whitey said. "First try and everything?" "We're in." Sean pulled back hard, taking the lock cylinder with him, getting a glimpse of the hole he'd left behind before the latch clicked free and the trunk lid rose up and that low-tide smell was replaced by something worse, a combined stench of swamp gas and boiled meat left rotting in a pile of scrambled eggs.`,
  `"Jesus." Connolly pressed his tie over his face and stepped back from the car. Whitey said, "Monte Cristo sandwich, anyone?" and Connolly turned the shade of grass. Souza was cool, though. He stepped up to the trunk, one hand pinching his nose, and said, "Where's the guy's face?" "That's his face," Sean said. The guy was curled in a fetal position, his head tilted back and to the side as if his neck were broken, the rest of his body curled in the opposite direction. His suit was top-shelf, his shoes, too, and Sean guessed his age at around fifty after a glance at his hands and hairline. He noticed a hole in the back of the guy's suit jacket, and he used a pen to lift the fabric away from his back. Sweat and heat yellowed the white shirt underneath, but Sean found a match for the hole in the jacket, halfway up the back, the shirt puckered into the flesh there. "Got an exit wound, Sarge. Definite gunshot." He peered into the trunk for a bit. "I can't find the shell, though." Whitey turned to Connolly as the man started to sway. "Get in your car and head back to the parking lot of the Last Drop. Inform the BPD first thing. We don't need a fucking turf war. Work your way out from where you found the majority of the blood in that parking lot. There's a good chance there's a bullet there somewhere, Trooper. You got me?" Connolly nodded, gulping air. Sean said, "Bullet entered the sternum through the lowest quadrant, almost dead center." Whitey said to Connolly, "Get CSS down there and as many troopers as you can without pissing off the BPD. You find that bullet, and you personally accompany it to the lab." Sean craned his head into the trunk and took a good look at the pulverized face.`,
  `"Judging by the amount of gravel, someone rammed his face off the pavement until they couldn't ram no more." Whitey put his hand on Connolly's shoulder. "Tell BPD they're going to need a full Homicide crew down here— techs, photographers, the on-call ADA, and the ME. Tell them Sergeant Powers requests someone who can give me a blood type on-scene. Go." Connolly was elated to just get the hell away from the smell. He ran to his cruiser, had it in gear and fishtailing out of the lot in under a minute. Whitey shot a roll of film around the outside of the car and then nodded at Souza. Souza slid on a pair of surgical gloves and used a slim jim to pop the passenger door lock. "You find any ID?" Whitey asked Sean. Sean said, "Wallet in his back pocket. Take some shots while I get my gloves on." Whitey came around and photographed the body, then let the camera hang from the strap around his neck as he scribbled a crime-scene diagram in his report pad. Sean pulled the wallet from the corpse's back pocket and flipped it open as Souza called from the front of the car: "Registration's in the name of August Larson of Three-two-three Sandy Pine Lane in Weston." Sean looked down at the driver's license. "Same guy." Whitey looked over his shoulder. "He got an organ donor card in there, anything like that?" Sean searched through credit cards and video club cards, a health club membership ID, AAA card, finally found a Tufts Health Plan ID. He held it up so Whitey could see it. "Blood type, 'A.'" "Souza," Whitey said. "Call Dispatch. Put out an APB on David Boyle, Fifteen Crescent Street, East Buckingham. White male, brown hair, blue eyes, five-foot-ten, a hundred-sixty-five pounds.`,
  `He took a sip of his orange juice and waited for Ray. *** "LOOK AT THIS," Sean said, pulling the latent prints file from the box and opening it in front of Whitey. "That's the cleanest one they pulled off the door. It's small because it's a kid's." Whitey said, "Old Lady Prior heard two kids playing on the street just before Katie banged her car up. Playing with hockey sticks, she said." "She said she heard Katie say 'Hi.' Maybe it wasn't Katie. A little kid's voice could sound like a woman's. And no footprints? Of course not. What do they weigh— a hundred pounds?" "You recognize that kid's voice?" "Sounded a lot like Johnny O'Shea's." Whitey nodded. "The other kid not saying anything at all." "Because he can't fucking speak," Sean said. *** "HEY, RAY," Brendan said as the two boys entered the apartment. Ray nodded. Johnny O'Shea waved. They started heading back toward the bedroom. "Come on in here a sec, Ray." Ray looked at Johnny. "Just a second, Ray. I got something I want to ask you." Ray turned and Johnny O'Shea dropped the gym bag he'd been carrying and sat on the edge of Mrs. Harris's bed. Ray came down the short hall into the kitchen and held out his hands, looked at his brother like "What?" Brendan hooked a chair with his foot and pulled it out from under the table, nodded at it. Ray's head tilted up as if he smelled something in the air, a scent he wasn't fond of. He looked at the chair. He looked at Brendan. He signed, "What did I do?" "You tell me," Brendan said. "I didn't do anything." "So sit down." "I don't want to." "Why not?" Ray shrugged. Brendan said, "Who do you hate, Ray?" Ray looked at him like he was nuts.`,
