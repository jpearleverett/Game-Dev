  `Dave. He punched Dave in the chest, and Dave sat down. Jimmy pushed Sean. "What the hell you doing?" "He hit me," Sean said. "He didn't hit you," Jimmy said. Sean's eyes widened in disbelief and Jimmy's mimicked them. "He hit me." "He hit me," Jimmy said in a girl's voice, and pushed Sean again. "He's my fucking friend." "So am I," Sean said. "So am I," Jimmy said. "So am I, so am I, so am I." Dave Boyle stood up and laughed. Sean said, "Cut it out." "Cut it out, cut it out, cut it out." Jimmy pushed Sean again, the heels of his hands digging into Sean's ribs. "Make me. You wanna make me?" "You wanna make him?" And now Dave shoved Sean. Sean had no idea how this had happened. He couldn't even remember what had made Jimmy mad anymore or why Dave had been stupid enough to hit him in the first place. One second they were standing by the car. Now they were in the middle of the street and Jimmy was pushing him, his face screwed up and stunted, his eyes black and small, Dave starting to join in. "Come on. Make me." "I don't— " Another shove. "Come on, little girl." "Jimmy, can we just— ?" "No, we can't. You a little pussy, Sean? Huh?" He went to shove him again but stopped, and that wild (and tired, Sean could see that, too, suddenly) aloneness pummeled his features as he looked past Sean at something coming up the street. It was a dark brown car, square and long like the kind police detectives drove, a Plymouth or something, and its bumper stopped by their legs and the two cops looked out through the windshield at them, their faces watery in the reflected trees that swam across the glass.`,
  `"Don't look at him. Look at me." The big cop breathed loudly through his nostrils. "You live here, kid?" "Huh? No." "No?" The cop bent over Dave. "Where you live, son?" "Rester Street." Still looking at Jimmy. "Flats trash in the Point?" The cop's cherry-red lips swiveled as if he were sucking a lollipop. "That can't be good for business, can it?" "Sir?" "Your mother home?" "Yes, sir." A tear fell down Dave's cheek and Sean and Jimmy looked away. "Well, we're going to have a talk with her, tell her what her punk kid's been up to." "I don't…I don't…" Dave blubbered. "Get in." The cop opened up the back door and Sean caught a whiff of apples, a sharp, October scent. Dave looked at Jimmy. "Get in," the cop said. "Or you want I should throw the cuffs on you?" "I— " "What?" The cop sounded pissed now. He slapped the top of the open door. "Get the fuck inside." Dave climbed into the backseat, bawling. The cop pointed a stubby finger at Jimmy and Sean. "Go tell your mothers what you been up to. And don't let me catch you shits fighting on my streets again." Jimmy and Sean stepped back, and the cop hopped in his car and drove off. They watched it reach the corner and then turn right, Dave's head, darkened by distance and shadows, looking back at them. And then the street was empty again, seemed to have gone mute with the slam of the car door. Jimmy and Sean stood where the car had been, looked at their feet, up and down the street, anywhere but at each other. Sean got that lurching sensation again, this time accompanied by the taste of dirty pennies in his mouth. His stomach felt as if a spoon had hollowed it out.`,
  `Sean squared himself, getting ready for whatever he thought Jimmy was going to say, all business, cop's eyes staring back at Jimmy, no mercy in them. "That's my daughter's car," Jimmy said. "I know. I— " Jimmy held up a hand. "Sean? That's my daughter's car. It's got blood in it. She don't show up for work this morning, don't show up for her little sister's First Communion. No one's seen her since last night. Okay? That's my daughter we're talking about, Sean. You don't have kids, I don't expect you to understand all the way, but come on, man. My daughter." Sean's cop's eyes stayed cop's eyes, Jimmy not even making a dent. "What do you want me to say here, Jimmy? If you want to tell me who she was out with last night, I'll send some officers to talk to them. She had enemies, I'll go round them up. You want— " "They brought fucking dogs in, Sean. Dogs, for my daughter. Dogs and frogmen." "Yeah, they did. And we got half the fucking force in there, Jimmy. State and BPD. And two helicopters, and two boats, and we're going to find her. But you, there's nothing you can do, man. Not right now. Nothing. We clear?" Jimmy looked back at Chuck standing on the curb, eyes on the weeds leading into the park, body tilting forward, ready to rip through his own skin. "Why you got frogmen looking for my daughter, Sean?" "We're covering all bases, Jimmy. We got a body of water, that's how we search it." "Is she in the water?" "All she is is missing, Jimmy. That's it." Jimmy turned away from him for a moment, his mind not working too well, getting black and gummy. He wanted in that park. He wanted to walk down the joggers' path and see Katie walking toward him.`,
  `"It's a little thing, Celeste. We asked Dave some questions today because he was in McGills the same time Katie was. Some of Dave's answers didn't add up and it's bothering my partner. Me, I just figure Dave had had a few that night and can't remember exact details, but my partner, he's a pain in the ass. So, I just need to know what time he came back, exactly, so I can get my partner off my back and we can concentrate on finding Katie's killer." "You think Dave did it?" Sean leaned back from the car, cocked his head at her. "I didn't say anything like that, Celeste. Hell, why would I even think that?" "Well, I don't know." "But you said it." Celeste said, "What? What are we talking about? I'm confused." Sean smiled as comfortingly as he could. "The sooner I know what time Dave came home, the sooner I can get my partner to move on to other things besides holes in your husband's story." For a moment, she looked like she might hurl herself backward into traffic. She looked that abandoned, that confused, and Sean felt the same raw pity for her that he often felt for her husband. "Celeste," he said, knowing Whitey would give him an F on his probationary report if he heard what he was about to say, "I don't think Dave did anything. I swear to God. But my partner does, and he's the ranking officer. He decides which avenues the investigation explores. You tell me what time Dave got home, we'll be done here. And Dave will never have to worry about us again." Celeste said, "But you saw this car." "What?" "I heard you talking earlier. Someone saw this car parked outside the Last Drop the night Katie was killed.`,
  `She said, "I was asleep." "Huh?" "I was asleep," she said. "Saturday night, when Dave got home. I was already in bed." The cop nodded. He leaned into the car again, patted his hands on the roof. He seemed satisfied. He seemed as if all his questions had been answered. She remembered that his hair had been very thick and had almost toffee-colored streaks up by the crown amid the light brown. She remembered thinking he'd never have to worry about going bald. "Celeste," he said in that smoky, amber voice of his, "I think you're scared." Celeste felt like her heart was clenched in a dirty hand. "I think you're scared and I think you know something. I want you to understand that I'm on your side. I'm on Dave's side, too. But I'm on your side more because, like I said, you're scared." "I'm not scared," she managed, and opened the driver's door. "Yes, you are," Sean said, and stepped back from the car as she got in it and drove off down the avenue. 19 WHO THEY'D PLANNED TO BE WHEN SEAN got back up to the apartment, he found Jimmy in the hallway, talking on a cordless phone. Jimmy said, "Yeah, I'll remember the photographs. Thank you," and hung up. He looked at Sean. "Reed's Funeral Home," he said. "They picked up her body from the medical examiner's office, said I can come down with her effects." He shrugged. "You know, finalize the service details, that sort of thing." Sean nodded. "You get your report pad?" Sean patted his pocket. "Right here." Jimmy tapped the cordless against his thigh several times. "So, I guess I better get down to Reed's." "You look like you could use some sleep, man." "No, I'm all right." "Okay." As Sean went to pass him, Jimmy said, "I was wondering if I could ask you a favor." Sean stopped.`,
  `You're holding her dress up like she's still inside of it, and you couldn't even look at me. I start thinking about it. I think, why would my own wife seem repulsed by me? And then it hits me — Sean. He said something to you, didn't he? Him and that creepy fucking partner of his asked you questions." "No." "No? Bullshit." She didn't like how calm he was. She could chalk some of that up to the beer, Dave having always been something of a mellow drunk, but there was an ugly air to his calm now, a sense of something coiled too tightly. "David— " "Oh, it's 'David.'" "— I don't think anything. I'm just confused." He tilted his head and looked back up at her. "Well, let's talk it out then, honey. That's the key to any good relationship— solid communication." She had $147 in her checking account and a five-hundred-dollar limit on her Visa, with about two-fifty already spent. Even if she could get Michael out of here, they wouldn't get far. Two or three nights in a motel somewhere, and Dave would find them. He'd never been a stupid man. He could track them, she was sure. The bag. She could hand over the trash bag to Sean Devine and he could find blood in the fabric of Dave's clothes, she was sure. She'd heard all about the advances they'd been making in DNA technology. They'd find Katie's blood on the clothes and arrest Dave. "Come on," Dave said. "Let's talk, honey. Let's hash this out. I'm serious. I want to, what's it, allay your fears." "I'm not afraid." "You look it." "I'm not." "Okay." He brought his heels off the coffee table. "So tell me what's, uh, bothering you, honey?" "You're drunk." He nodded.`,
  `He stood, deciding he'd have to tell Val and Jimmy that he'd need to get something to eat before he had another drink. It didn't have to be great food, just substantive. And when he turned around, they were standing by the black door, Val to the left of it, Jimmy to the right, the door shut tight, Dave thinking they looked kind of funny, like they were here to deliver furniture, couldn't see where they were going to drop it in all those weeds. Dave said, "Hey, guys. Come to make sure I didn't fall in?" Jimmy came off the wall and walked toward him, and the light that hung over the door snapped off. Jimmy, gone black in the dark, approached slowly, his white face picking up some light from the bridge and moving in and out of shadow. "Let me tell you about Ray Harris," Jimmy said, talking so quietly that Dave had to lean forward. "Ray Harris was a buddy of mine, Dave. He used to come and visit me when I was in prison. He used to check up on Marita and Katie and my mother, see if they needed anything. He did these things so I'd think he was my friend, but the real reason was guilt. He felt guilty for getting his balls caught in a vise and ratting me out to the police. He felt real bad about it. But after he'd been coming by the prison for a few months, a weird thing happened." Jimmy reached Dave, and he stopped, looked into Dave's face with his head slightly cocked. "I discovered I liked Ray. I mean, I honestly enjoyed the guy's company. We'd talk about sports, about God, about books, about our wives, our children, the politics of the day, what have you.`,
  `"No?" Sean said. "Celeste says she told you that Dave killed Katie. Seems to think you believed the same thing. She got the feeling you were going to do something about it." Jimmy stared through the tunnel at a sewer grate. "You going to send five hundred a month to Celeste now, Jimmy?" Jimmy looked up and each of them saw it at the same time in the other's face— Sean could see what Jimmy had done, and Jimmy could see that knowledge appear in Sean. "You fucking did it, didn't you?" Sean said. "You killed him." Jimmy stood up, holding on to the banister. "Don't know what you're talking about." "You killed both of them— Ray Harris and Dave Boyle. Jesus, Jimmy, I came down here thinking the whole idea was nuts, but I can see it in your face, man. You crazy, lunatic, fucking psycho piece of shit. You did it. You killed Dave. You killed Dave Boyle. Our friend, Jimmy." Jimmy snorted. "Our friend. Yeah, okay, Point Boy, he was your good buddy. Hung with him all the time, right?" Sean stepped into his face. "He was our friend, Jimmy. Remember?" Jimmy looked into Sean's eyes, wondered if he was going to take a swing at him. "Last time I saw Dave," he said, "was at my house last night." He pushed Sean aside and crossed the street onto Gannon. "That's the last time I saw Dave." "You're full of shit." He turned, arms wide as he looked back at Sean. "Then arrest me, you're so sure." "I'll get the evidence," Sean said. "You know I will." "You'll get shit," Jimmy said. "Thanks for busting my daughter's killers, Sean. Really. Maybe if you'd been a little faster, though?" Jimmy shrugged and turned his back on him, started walking down Gannon Street.`,
  `You should have stayed gone. You came back here, to our home, and there were crucial pieces of you missing. You never fit back in, Dave, because they'd poisoned you and that poison was just waiting to spill back out. "I didn't kill your daughter, Jimmy. I didn't kill Katie. I didn't, I didn't." Maybe you didn't, Dave. I know that now. It's starting to look like you actually had nothing to do with it. Still a small chance the cops got the wrong kids, but I'll admit, all in all, it looks like you may have been guiltfree on the Katie account. "So?" So you killed someone, Dave. You killed someone. Celeste was right about that. Besides, you know how it is with kids who get molested. "No, Jim. Why don't you tell me?" They turn into molesters themselves. Sooner or later. The poison's in you and it has to come out. I was just protecting some poor future victim from your poison, Dave. Maybe your son. "Leave my son out of this." Fine. Maybe one of his friends then. But, Dave, sooner or later, you would have shown your true colors. "That's how you live with it?" Once you got in that car, Dave, you should never have come back. That's how I live with it. You didn't belong. Don't you get it? That's all a neighborhood is— a place where people who belong together live. All others need not fucking apply. Dave's voice fell through the water and drummed into Jimmy's skull: "I live in you now, Jimmy. You can't shut me off." Yes, Dave, I can. And Jimmy turned the shower off and stepped out of the tub. He dried off and sucked the soft steam up his nostrils. If anything, it left him feeling even more clearheaded.`,
  `"I'm a bit buzzed," she admitted. That amused Roman. He gave her a short laugh, flashed his perfect teeth, and took a sip of Tanqueray. "A bit buzzed, huh? Yeah, okay, Katie. Let me ask you something," he said gently. "You think Bobby would like hearing you were making a fucking ass of yourself at McGills tonight? You think he'd like hearing that?" "No." "'Cause I didn't like hearing it, Katie. You see what I'm saying?" "Right." Roman cupped a hand behind his ear. "What's that?" "Right." Roman left his hand where it was, leaned into her. "I'm sorry. What?" "I'll go home right now," Katie said. Roman smiled. "You sure? I don't want to make you do anything you don't feel like." "No, no. I've had enough." "Sure, sure. Hey, can I settle your tab?" "No, no. Thanks, Roman, we already paid cash." Roman slung his arm around his bimbo. "Call you a cab?" Katie almost slipped up and said she'd driven here, but she caught herself. "No, no. This time of night? We'll flag one down no problem." "Yeah, you will. All right then, Katie, we'll be seeing you." Eve and Diane were already at the door, had been, in fact, since they'd first seen Roman. Out on the sidewalk, Diane said, "Jesus. You think he'll call Bobby?" Katie shook her head, though she wasn't positive. "No. Roman doesn't deliver bad news. He just takes care of it." She put her hand over her face for a moment and in the darkness, she felt the alcohol turn to an itchy sludge in her blood and the weight of her aloneness. She'd always felt alone, ever since her mother had died, and her mother had died a long, long time ago. In the parking lot, Eve threw up, some of it splashing against one of the rear tires of Katie's blue Toyota.`,
  `Before this got any nuttier and someone got shot or the guy went all harakiri on them, Sean cleared his throat and said, "Excuse me, sir. Sir? Excuse me." The guy's head cocked slightly as if he'd heard Sean, but he continued that deliberate pivot, revolving in increments toward them. "Sir, we need you to lay your weapon on the grass." The guy's foot dropped back to the ground and he turned to face them, his eyes widening and then clicking on each of them— one, two, three, four guns— and he held out the sword, either pointing it at them or trying to hand it to them, Sean couldn't tell which. Connolly said, "The fuck— you deaf? On the ground." Sean said, "Sssh," and stopped moving, ten feet from the guy now, thinking about the blood drops they'd found along the jogging path about sixty yards back, all four of them knowing what the drops meant, and then looking up to see Bruce Lee over here brandishing a sword the length of a small plane. Except Bruce Lee had been Asian and this guy was definitely white, youngish, maybe twenty-five, with curly black hair and shaven cheeks, white T-shirt tucked into gray sweats. He was frozen now, and Sean was pretty sure it was fear that kept that sword pointed at them, the brain seizing up and unable to command the body. "Sir," Sean said, sharp enough for the guy to look directly at him. "Do me a favor, okay? Put the sword down on the ground. Just open your fingers and let it drop." "Who the hell are you guys?" "We're police officers." Whitey Powers flashed his badge. "See? So, trust me here, sir, and drop that sword." "Uh, sure," the guy said, and just like that it fell from his fingers, hit the grass with a damp thud.`,
  `Sean felt Connolly starting to move on his left, ready to rush the guy, and he put out his hand, kept the guy's eyes locked with his, and said, "What's your name?" "Huh? Kent." "Kent, how you doing? I'm State Trooper Devine. I need you to just take a couple of steps back from the weapon." "The weapon?" "The sword, Kent. Take a couple of steps back. What's your last name, Kent?" "Brewer," he said, and backed up, his palms held up and out now like he was sure they were going to draw their Glocks all at once and unload. Sean smiled and threw a nod at Whitey. "Hey, Kent, what was that you were doing out here? Looked like some kind of ballet to me." He shrugged. "With a sword, sure, but…" Kent watched Whitey bend by the sword and pick it up gently by the hilt with a handkerchief. "Kendo." "What's that, Kent?" "Kendo," Kent said. "It's a martial art. I take it Tuesdays and Thursdays and practice in the mornings. I was just practicing. That's all." Connolly sighed. Souza looked at Connolly. "You're dicking me, right?" Whitey held out the sword blade for Sean to see. It was oiled and shiny and so clean it could have just come off the press. "Look." Whitey slid the blade across his open palm. "I've had sharper spoons." "It's never been sharpened," Kent said. Sean felt that bird in his skull again, screeching. "Ah, Kent, how long you been here?" Kent looked at the parking lot a hundred yards behind them. "Fifteen minutes? Tops. What's this about?" His voice was gaining confidence now, a shade of indignation. "It's not illegal to practice kendo in a public park, Officer, is it?" "We're working on it, though," Whitey said. "And that's 'Sergeant,' Kent." "You account for your whereabouts late last night, early this morning?" Sean asked.`,
  `Your DNA, Dave. Is it so 'gone' that it'll never be found?" Dave didn't have an answer for that one, so he just stared at his wife until she changed the subject. "You check the paper this morning?" "Sure," he said. "You see anything?" "About what?" Celeste hissed: "About what?" "Oh…oh. Yeah." Dave shook his head. "No, there was nothing. No mention of it. 'Member, honey, it was late." "It was late. Come on. Metro pages? They're always the last to go in, everyone waiting for the police blotters." "You work for a newspaper, do you?" "This isn't a joke, Dave." "No, honey, it's not. I'm just saying there's nothing in the morning paper. That's all. Why? I don't know. We'll watch the noon news, see what's there." Celeste looked back down at the grass, nodded to herself several times. "We going to see anything, Dave?" Dave stepped back from her. "I mean about some black guy found beat half to death in a parking lot outside…where was it?" "The, ah, Last Drop." "The— ah— Last Drop?" "Yeah, Celeste." "Oh, okay, Dave," she said. "Sure." And she left him. She gave him her back and walked up the stairs to the porch, walked inside, and Dave listened to the soft footfalls of her bare feet as she climbed the staircase. That's what they did. They left you. Maybe not physically all the time. But emotionally, mentally? They were never there when you needed them. It had been the same with his mother. That morning after the police had brought him home, his mother had cooked him breakfast, her back to him, humming "Old MacDonald," and occasionally turning to look back over her shoulder at him to toss him a nervous smile, as if he were a boarder she wasn't sure about.`,
  `I'm cool for now. Ain't no other choice, is there?" Chuck didn't answer and Jimmy looked across Sydney, past his daughter's car, to see Sean Devine walking out of the park and into the weeds, eyes on Jimmy the whole way, Sean a tall guy and moving fast, but Jimmy could still see that thing in his face he'd always hated, the look of a guy the world had always worked for, Sean wearing it like a bigger badge than the one clipped to his belt, pissing people off with it even if he wasn't aware of it. "Jimmy," Sean said, and shook his hand. "Hey, man." "Hey, Sean. I heard you were in there." "Since early this morning." Sean looked back over his shoulder, then around again to Jimmy. "I can't tell you anything right now, Jimmy." "She in there?" Jimmy could hear the tremor in his own voice. "I don't know, Jim. We haven't found her. I can tell you that much." "So let us in," Chuck said. "We can help look. See it all the time on the news, ordinary citizens searching for missing kids and shit." Sean kept his eyes on Jimmy, as if Chuck wasn't even there. "It's a little more than that, Jimmy. We can't have any nonpolice personnel in there until we've gone over every inch of the scene." "And what's the scene?" Jimmy asked. "The whole damn park at the moment. Look"— Sean patted Jimmy's shoulder— "I came out here to tell you guys there's nothing you can do right now. I'm sorry. I really am. But there it is. We know anything— the first thing, Jimmy? We'll tell you immediately. No bullshit." Jimmy nodded and touched Sean's elbow. "I talk to you a sec?" "Sure." They left Chuck Savage on the curb and walked a few yards down the street.`,
  `He couldn't think. He needed in. "You want a public relations nightmare on your hands?" Jimmy asked. "You want to have to bust me and every single one of the Savage brothers trying to get in there and look for our loved one?" Jimmy knew the moment he stopped speaking that it was a weak threat, a grasp, and he hated that Sean knew it, too. Sean nodded. "I don't want to. Believe me. But if I have to, Jimmy, yeah. I will, man." Sean flipped open a notepad. "Look, just tell me who she was with last night, what she was doing, and I'll— " Jimmy was already walking away when Sean's walkie-talkie went off, loud and shrill. He turned back as Sean put it to his lips, said, "Go." "We got something, Trooper." "Say again." Jimmy stepped up to Sean, heard the barely suppressed emotion in the voice of the guy on the other end of the walkie-talkie. "I said we got something. Sergeant Powers said you need to get in here. Uh, ASAP, Trooper. Like right now." "Your location?" "The drive-in screen, Trooper. And, man, it's a fucking mess." 10 EVIDENCE CELESTE WATCHED the twelve o'clock news on the small TV they kept up on the kitchen counter. She ironed as she watched, aware at one point that she could be mistaken for a 1950s housewife, doing menial chores and tending to the child while her husband went off to work carrying his metal lunchpail, returned home expecting a drink in his hand and dinner on the table. But it wasn't like that, really. Dave, for all his faults, pitched in when it came to housework. He was a duster and vacuumer and dishwasher, whereas Celeste took pleasure in laundry, in the sorting and folding and ironing, in the warm smell of fabric that had been cleansed and smoothed of wrinkles.`,
  `"No, sir. A momentary lapse of judgment." "Several of them," Friel said. "Yes, sir." "Your personal life's a mess, Trooper, that's your problem. Don't let it bleed back into your job." Sean looked at Friel, caught a charged-electrode sheen in his eyes he'd seen before, a sheen that meant Friel was in a place where you couldn't argue with him. Again Sean nodded, sucking it up. Friel gave him a cold smile and watched a news copter arc in over the screen, flying lower than the agreed-upon distance, Friel getting a look on his face like he was going to be handing someone severance pay before sunset. "You know the family, right?" Friel said, tracking the chopper. "You grew up here." "I grew up in the Point." "That's here." "This is the Flats. Bit of a difference, sir." Friel waved it away. "You grew up here. You were one of the first onscene, and you know these people." He spread his hands. "I'm wrong?" "About what?" "Your ability to handle this." He gave Sean his summer-softball-coach smile. "You're one of my bright boys, right? Served your penance, ready to get back on the ball?" "Yes, sir," Sean said. You bet, sir. Whatever it takes to keep this job, sir. They looked over at the van as something thumped to the floor inside and the chassis dipped toward the wheels. The chassis bounced back up, and Friel said, "You notice they always drop them?" They always did. Katie Marcus, zipped in the dark, plastic heat of a body bag now. Dumped inside that van, her hair matting to the plastic, organs softening. "Trooper," Friel said, "You know what I like even less than ten-year-old black boys getting shot by bullshit gang-war crossfire?" Sean knew the answer, but he didn't say anything.`,
  `"Hey, don't make too much of it. It was just a look." "I'm not making anything out of it, Mr. Marcus, I promise. It's just info. That's what I do— I collect pieces of info until two or three pieces fit together. You say you were in prison?" Annabeth said, "Jesus," very softly, and shook her head. Jimmy leaned back in his chair. "Here we go." "I'm just asking," Whitey said. "You'd do the same if I'd said I worked at Sears fifteen years ago, right?" Jimmy chuckled. "I did time for a robbery. Two years at Deer Island. You write that in your notebook. That piece of information going to help you catch the guy who killed my daughter, Sergeant? I mean, I'm just asking." Whitey shot a glance Sean's way. Sean said, "Jim, no one means to offend anyone here. Let's just let it pass, get back to the point." "The point," Jimmy said. "Outside of that look Katie gave you," Sean said, "was there anything else out of the ordinary you can remember?" Jimmy took his convict-in-the-yard stare off Whitey and drank some coffee. "No. Nothing. Wait— this kid, Brendan Harris— But, no, that was this morning." "What about him?" "He's just a kid from the neighborhood. He came in today and asked if Katie was around like he'd been expecting to see her. But they barely knew each other. It was just a little strange. It doesn't mean anything." Whitey wrote the kid's name down anyway. "Could she have been dating him maybe?" Sean said. "No." Annabeth said, "You never know, Jim…" "I know," Jimmy said. "She wouldn't date that kid." "No?" Sean said. "No." "Why you so sure?" "Hey, Sean, what the fuck? You're going to grill me?" "I'm not grilling you, Jim. I'm just asking how you could be so sure your daughter wasn't seeing this Brendan Harris kid." Jimmy blew air out of his mouth and up at the ceiling.`,
  `"Like you're giving us a deadline," Whitey said. "Trooper Devine pledged that he'd find my daughter's killer. I'm just asking in what sort of time frame he thinks this will happen." "Trooper Devine," Whitey said, "is not in charge of this investigation. I am. And we will depth-charge whoever did this, Mr. and Mrs. Marcus. What I don't need is anyone getting it in their head that our fear of a war between the Savage and O'Donnell crews can be used as some sort of leverage against us. I think that, I'll arrest them all on public nuisance charges and lose the paperwork until this is over." A couple of janitors walked past them, trays in hand, the soggy food on top letting off a gray steam. Sean felt the air in the place grow staler, the night close in around them. "So, okay," Jimmy said with a bright smile. "Okay, what?" "Find her killer. I won't stand in your way." He turned to his wife as he stood and offered her his hand. "Honey?" Whitey said, "Mr. Marcus." Jimmy looked down at him as his wife took his hand and stood. "There'll be a trooper downstairs to drive you home," Whitey said, and reached into his wallet. "If you think of anything, give us a call." Jimmy took Whitey's card and placed it in his back pocket. Now that she was standing, Annabeth looked a lot less steady, like her legs were filled with liquid. She squeezed her husband's hand and her own whitened. "Thank you," she whispered to Sean and Whitey. Sean could see the ravages of the day finding her face and body now, beginning to drape her. The harsh light above them caught her face, and Sean could see what she'd look like when she was much older— a handsome woman, scarred by wisdom she'd never asked for.`,
  `Whitey pulled a chair over to them and said, "Hey, Roman, they sell men's clothes where you got that shirt?" Roman kept his eyes on his paper, popped a piece of croissant in his mouth. "Sergeant Powers, how you doing? How's that Hyundai working out for you?" Whitey chuckled as Sean sat down beside him. "Looking at you, Roman, you know, in this place, I'd swear you were just another yuppie, ready to get up in the morning and go do some day trading on your iMac." "Got a PC, Sergeant." Roman closed his paper and looked at Whitey and Sean for the first time. "Oh, hi," he said to Sean. "I know you from somewhere." "Sean Devine, State Police." "Right, right," Roman said. "Sure, I remember now. Saw you in court once testifying against a friend of mine. Nice suit. They're stepping things up at Sears these days, huh? Getting hip." Whitey glanced over at the model. "Get you a steak or something, honey?" The model said, "What?" "Maybe some glucose on an IV drip? My treat." Roman said, "Don't do that. This is business, right? Keep it between us." The model said, "Roman, I don't get it." Roman smiled. "It's okay, Michaela. Just ignore us." "Michaela," Whitey said. "Cool name." Michaela kept her eyes on her newspaper. "What brings you by, Sergeant?" "The scones," Whitey said. "Love the scones in this place. And, oh yeah, you know a woman named Katherine Marcus, Roman?" "Sure." Roman took a small sip of his latte and wiped his upper lip with his napkin, dropped it back on his lap. "She was found dead this afternoon, I heard." "She was," Whitey said. "Never good for the neighborhood rep when something like that happens." Whitey crossed his arms, looked at Roman. Roman chewed another piece of croissant and drank some more latte.`,
  `You want to stand here and play fucking grand patriarch?" Theo looked down at his shoes and breathed heavily through his nostrils, both fists clenched and flexing. "I don't think I deserve that." Jimmy stood and placed his chair back against the kitchen table. He lifted a cooler off the floor. He looked at the door. He said, "Can we go back down now, Theo?" "Sure," Theo said. He left his chair where it was and lifted the other cooler off the floor. He said, "Okay, okay. Bad idea, me trying to talk to you this morning of all mornings. You're not ready yet. But— " "Theo? Just leave it. Just don't talk. How about that? Okay?" Jimmy hefted the cooler and started back downstairs. He wondered if maybe he'd hurt Theo's feelings, then decided he really didn't give a shit if he had. Fuck him. Right about now they'd be starting the autopsy on Katie. Jimmy could still smell her crib, but down in the medical examiner's office, they were laying out the scalpels and chest spreaders, powering up their bone saws. *** LATER, AFTER it had thinned out a bit, Jimmy went out onto the back porch and sat under the flapping clothes that had been hanging from the lines stretched across the porch since Saturday afternoon. He sat there with the sun warming him and a pair of Nadine's denim overalls swaying back and forth through his hair. Annabeth and the girls had cried all last night, filled the apartment with their weeping, and Jimmy had figured he'd join them any second. But he hadn't. He had screamed on that slope when he saw the look in Sean Devine's eyes that told him his daughter was dead. Screamed himself hoarse. But outside of that, he hadn't been able to feel anything.`,
  `He seemed like he really loved your daughter." "Fuck," Jimmy said. Sean leaned against the wall and waited, giving Jimmy time to take it all in. "Elope?" Jimmy said after a while. "Yeah. Jim, according to Brendan Harris and both of Katie's girlfriends, you were dead set against them ever dating. What I don't understand is why. Kid didn't strike me as a problem kid. You know? Maybe a bit dim, I dunno. But he seemed decent, nice really. I'm confused." "You're confused?" Jimmy chuckled. "I just found out my daughter— who is, you know, dead— was planning to elope, Sean." "I know," Sean said, lowering his voice to nearly a whisper in hopes Jimmy would follow suit, the man about as agitated as Sean had seen him since yesterday afternoon by the drive-in screen. "I'm just curious, man— why were you so adamant that your daughter never see the kid?" Jimmy leaned against the wall beside Sean and took a few long breaths, let them out slow. "I knew his father. They called him 'Just Ray.'" "What, he was a judge?" Jimmy shook his head. "There were so many guys named Ray around at the time— you know, Crazy Ray Bucheck and Psycho Ray Dorian and Ray the Woodchuck Lane— that Ray Harris got stuck with 'Just Ray' because all the cool nicknames had been taken." He shrugged. "Anyway, I never liked the guy much and then he cut out on his wife when she was pregnant with that mute kid she's got now and Brendan only six, so I dunno, I just thought, 'The acorn don't fall far from the tree' and shit, and I didn't want him seeing my daughter." Sean nodded, though he didn't buy it. Something about the way Jimmy had said he'd never liked the guy much— there was a small hitch in his voice, and Sean had heard enough bullshit stories in his time to recognize one no matter how logical it may have sounded.`,
  `He opened the door and had crossed the threshold when she saw his hand curl around the wood and he leaned his head back in. Just his head, tilted and staring at her, when he said, "Oh, I took care of the trash, by the way." "What?" "The trash bag," he said. "Where you put my clothes and stuff? I took it out earlier and threw it away." "Oh," she said, and felt the need to vomit again. "So, I'll be seeing you." "Yeah," she said as he ducked his head back out onto the landing. "I'll see you." She listened to his footfalls until they reached the bottom landing. She heard the front door creak open and Dave step out onto the porch and descend the steps. She went over the stairs leading up to Michael's room and she could hear him sleeping up there, his breathing deep. Then she went into the bathroom and threw up. *** HE COULDN'T FIND where Celeste had parked the car. Sometimes, particularly during snowstorms, you might drive eight blocks before you found a parking space, so Celeste could have buried the car as far away as the Point for all Dave knew, even though he noticed some empty spaces not far from the house. It was probably just as well. He was too hammered to drive in all likelihood. Maybe a good long walk would help him clear his head. He walked up Crescent to Buckingham Avenue and took a left, wondering what the hell had been going through his head that he'd tried to explain things to Celeste. Christ, he'd even said those names— Henry and George. He'd mentioned werewolves, for crying out loud. Shit. And now it was confirmed— the police suspected him. They'd be watching. No more thinking of Sean as an old long-lost friend.`,
